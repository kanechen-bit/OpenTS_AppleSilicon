The file is optional and every key has a default, so a file names only what it changes. It holds one section, `[Ingame]`.

```ini title="UI.INI"
[Ingame]
AlwaysShowActionLines=yes
MovementLineDashed=yes
MovementLineColor=0,255,0
NavComQueueLineThick=yes
```

A colour is three values from 0 to 255 for red, green and blue, separated by commas; a value that is not three numbers keeps the default. [Action lines](/systems/action-lines/) explains what each line is and when it is drawn.

## When the file is read

The file is read once at start-up, after the game archives are registered, and again each time a side's archives are mounted, which happens as a scenario loads. Every read first returns each value to its default, so a value the file no longer names goes back to the default rather than lingering from an earlier read, and a copy inside a side's archive takes effect for that side.

The file is opened through the game's file layer, so it may be loose in any folder the game searches or inside an archive, and a loose copy is used ahead of an archived one. [OPENTS.INI](/formats/opents-ini/#the-order-files-are-searched-for-in) lists the folders and the order they are searched in.
