A section begins with `[`, ends at the first `]`, and supplies the section name between them. An assignment uses the first `=` to separate its key from its value. Surrounding whitespace is removed from both parts.

```ini title="example.ini"
[General]
Name=Example ; text after the semicolon is a comment
```

A line beginning with `;` is a comment. A semicolon also starts an inline comment. Lines before the first valid section and assignments with an empty key or value are ignored.

Text is UTF-8, and a byte order mark at the start of a file is ignored. A line that is not valid UTF-8 is read as Windows-1252, so a file written in that code page keeps its accented characters. Saving the database writes UTF-8 without a byte order mark.

Loading a second file into a database that already holds sections merges the two rather than replacing what is there: a section the database does not carry is added whole, and an assignment repeating a key already present overwrites that key's value.

A file that repeats a section header continues the section it already opened. An assignment repeating a key overwrites the value read earlier and moves the key to the end of its section. A file is therefore read the same way whether it opens a database or merges into one that already holds sections. A repeat within one file is written to the debug log with the file, section and key; a later file overriding an earlier one is not, since that is how the rules files stack.

A line may be any length. A reader that copies a value into fixed storage keeps as much of it as the storage holds, and writes the cut to the debug log once per key.

## Malformed values

A written value is converted by the reader for the kind of value expected. A value the reader cannot convert leaves the setting at its default, and the debug log records the file, section, key and value.

A floating-point number is read from the start of the value, so a value that does not start with a number is malformed. A percent sign anywhere in the value divides the number by 100 after it is read, so `50%` reads as `0.5`.

A point, offset, vector, color or rectangle is a comma-separated list of numbers, two, three or four of them as the key requires. Spaces around the commas are allowed, and anything after the last number is ignored. A value with fewer numbers than the key requires, or with something other than a number where one is expected, is malformed as a whole: no part of it is kept.

An omitted key is never malformed. It reads as its default without a log line.
