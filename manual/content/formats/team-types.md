`[TeamTypes]` values name the TeamType sections to load. The keys in each section select its owner, TaskForce, Script, origin waypoint, recruitment rules, and behavior flags.

OpenTS loads `AI.INI`, then `AIFS.INI` when Firestorm is enabled, then the map-local definitions.

```ini title="AI.INI, AIFS.INI, or map file"
[TeamTypes]
0=MyAttackTeam ; example TeamType

[MyAttackTeam]
House=GDI
TaskForce=MyAttackForce ; defined under [TaskForces]
Script=MyAttackScript   ; defined under [ScriptTypes]
Waypoint=A
```
