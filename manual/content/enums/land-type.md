A cell's land type is derived rather than authored: it comes from the tile drawn beneath the cell, and a tile can only produce nine of these twelve. `Wall`, `Tiberium` and `Weeds` reach a cell through an overlay standing on it, which [`Land`](/keys/land/) covers. A rules setting can override both: with [`CliffBackImpassability=2`](/keys/cliffbackimpassability/), a cell standing a full cliff step below any of the six neighbors that setting examines is rewritten to `Rock` at the end of the same pass. Only four of the twelve are open to that rewrite on the ordinary path — `Clear`, `Water`, `Beach` and `Ice` — so a cell whose tile already reports `Road`, `Rough` or `Railroad` keeps that class whatever stands above it.

Each token also names the rules section that holds that terrain's movement costs — `[Clear]`, `[Road]`, `[Water]` and the rest — so the twelve classes are what [speed type](/reference/enums/speed-type/) is costed against. The set is fixed by the engine: a mod can retune a section but cannot add a thirteenth terrain class or a section for one.
