The names say which cells join a class's [movement zones](/glossary/#movement-zone), not what an object of that class may do to them. `Crusher` and the three destroyer classes decide only whether a cell held by a crushable overlay, a wall, or a terrain object that fills every one of its standing places counts as crossable while the zones are built and a route is plotted — so `Destroyer` opens fully blocking trees and rocks as readily as it opens walls. Whether a vehicle actually flattens a wall it drives into is [`Crusher=yes`](/keys/crusher/), which is read separately and can be set on a type of any class.

What each class is compared against is a single blockage rating held for the cell rather than its [land type](/reference/enums/land-type/); [`TemperateOccupationBits`](/keys/temperateoccupationbits/) covers how a terrain object's occupation figure moves its cell between classes without changing the terrain at all. The ten classes are fixed by the engine, each costing the map a zone table of its own; [`MovementZone`](/keys/movementzone/) covers what naming one does to a type.
