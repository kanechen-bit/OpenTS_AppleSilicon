The list is closed. `[Powerups]` is read by looking up each of these tokens in turn, so an entry written under any other name is never fetched and a mod cannot add a twentieth result. [Crates](/systems/crates/) covers how a result is drawn, what each one does, and the numbers `[Powerups]` supplies alongside the share.
