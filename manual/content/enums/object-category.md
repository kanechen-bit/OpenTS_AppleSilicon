Only one of the eleven ever decides anything. The dropship loadout screen leaves an InfantryType marked `Civilian` out of the cameos a player may pick from, and does even that only where the scenario supplies no allowable-units list of its own; nothing the engine itself calls compares against the other ten.

Each category carries two spellings and answers to both. The short token is the one the engine writes back out; the longer description is the wording an editor shows, and it is matched the same way with case ignored. A name that is neither leaves the type with no category at all rather than falling back on the previous one. `Soldier` and `Civilian` spell the two forms alike, so the table pairs the remaining nine — read it in either direction, since a rules file may carry the long form where a modder expects the short.

| Short token | Editor description |
| --- | --- |
| `VIP` | `VIP/Agent` |
| `Recon` | `Recon Vehicle` |
| `AFV` | `Armored Fighting Vehicle` |
| `IFV` | `Infantry Fighting Vehicle` |
| `LRFS` | `Indirect Fire Support` |
| `Support` | `Misc. Support Vehicle` |
| `Transport` | `Transport Vehicle` |
| `AirPower` | `Air Combat Support` |
| `AirLift` | `Air Transport` |
