These are the actions the engine picks between as the cursor crosses the map — what the mouse shape offers and what a left click will then do. They are not the trigger actions a map fires from its tags, which are a separate list.

One rules setting takes a name from here: a SuperWeaponType's [`Action`](/keys/action/). While the map is in that weapon's targeting mode the name becomes the action under the cursor, which is what picks the mouse shape, and it is also the key the click is matched on afterward: a click whose action is neither `None` nor `Select` is compared against every superweapon's `Action` in turn, and the first weapon carrying that action has a firing order queued for the cell. Two weapons naming the same action therefore leave the later one unreachable, and a weapon left at `None` neither takes the cursor nor can be fired by a click at all — which is where an unrecognized name lands it, since the parser reads anything it does not know as `None`.

Seven entries carry historical `DontUse` tokens even though their engine constants still name older actions. Nothing assigns or tests those seven, so what survives of them is the spelling: they are distinct names a superweapon can claim, and nothing more.
