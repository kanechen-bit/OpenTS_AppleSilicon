A radar event is the rotating box that closes in on one cell of the radar map to draw the player's eye there. The engine raises one when a base is attacked, when a harvester is attacked, and when an enemy is sensed; a map author raises any of the six through the [Create Radar Event](/mapping/actions/taction-radar-event/) trigger action. The kinds differ in the color they pulse: combat and the two attack events cycle orange to dark red, non-combat and drop-zone events green, and an enemy-sensed event yellow.

The rules.ini `[General]` lists [`RadarEventDurations`](/keys/radareventdurations/), [`RadarEventVisibilityDurations`](/keys/radareventvisibilitydurations/), and [`RadarEventSuppressionDistances`](/keys/radareventsuppressiondistances/) are indexed by these values positionally: one comma-separated entry per row below, in the order shown, and the lookup applies no bounds check, so a list shorter than six entries reads past its end for the later kinds. Only combat, harvester-attacked, and enemy-sensed events consult a suppression distance; the remaining three parse one and never read it.
