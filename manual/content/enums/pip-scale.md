A **pip** is one of the small markers drawn in a row beneath a selected object, and the scale names the quantity that row is counting. The [pip colors](/reference/enums/pip-color/) are a separate domain and decide what an individual marker looks like.

The five scales are fixed by the engine, and [`PipScale`](/keys/pipscale/) covers how each one sizes and fills its row — including the [`MaxCharge`](/keys/maxcharge/) a `Charge` row is measured against, and the length a `Power` row is given without ever being filled.
