[MyChaingun] ; example WeaponType
Burst=5
BurstDelay3=3 ; three frames between the fourth shot and the fifth
```

The value is the reload delay the firing object is given once its fourth shot of a burst has gone off, in game frames. `-1` asks for a random three to five frames instead, and the assignment is reached only on a weapon whose [`Burst`](/keys/burst/) is above `4`; at a burst of exactly four the fourth shot is the last one and pays [`ROF`](/keys/rof/).

This is the last gap the weapon can name. The fifth shot and every one after it takes a random three to five frames whatever these assignments say, because the table holds only four entries and no assignment reaches past it.
