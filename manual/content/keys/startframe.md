The frame a particle draws is chosen by its animation state, so a `Gas`, `WeakGas`, `Smoke` or `Web` sequence opens at the frame [`StartStateAI`](/keys/startstateai/) names, while a [`Fire`](/keys/behaveslike/#scope-particletype) particle opens at that state offset by the artwork bank its firing direction picks and a `Spark` or `Railgun` particle draws no artwork at all. No drawing path reads the figure stored here.
