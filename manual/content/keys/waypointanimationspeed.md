```ini title="rules.ini"
[AudioVisual]
WaypointAnimationSpeed=12
```

Each marker on a plotted waypoint path is drawn from the waypoint cursor's own frames, and a single counter picks the frame for all of them at once. The counter steps every time a timer expires, and the timer is then restarted from this value.

The unit is a system tick of sixteen milliseconds, not a game frame, so the default of 12 is a step roughly every fifth of a second and the markers keep animating at the same speed whatever the game speed is set to. The counter is only advanced once per game frame, so a value small enough to expire within a single frame gives one step per frame and no faster — around 4 at fifteen frames a second. A value of `0` reaches that ceiling immediately.

The setting reaches nothing else. It does not affect how far or how fast anything travels along the path, and [`MaxWaypointPathLength`](/keys/maxwaypointpathlength/) covers how many markers a path may hold.
