summary: Breaks the projectile into a burst of bomblets when it detonates.

  note: "Whatever `Airburst` stands at in the same section. The read takes its default from that flag rather than from this key's own stored value, so `Airburst=yes` alone leaves the projectile splitting."

An ordinary projectile applies its warhead [`Cluster`](/keys/cluster/) times, scattering each blast a cell or two from the point of impact. A splitting projectile applies it exactly once and then releases `Cluster` bomblets of its [`AirburstWeapon`](/keys/airburstweapon/) instead. Everything the bomblets carry — projectile, warhead, damage and range — comes from that weapon, and they are launched at its speed; a homing bomblet then works toward a hard-coded ceiling of 50 leptons per game frame rather than toward the weapon's own figure. [`RetargetAccuracy`](/keys/retargetaccuracy/) decides what each one is aimed at.

Three of the adjustments that move an ordinary detonation are skipped: it is not pulled back onto the point the fuse was aimed at, and neither of the close-range snaps onto an airborne or a ground target is applied. The walk onto a target it went off within 32 leptons of still happens, because that one is keyed to [`Airburst`](/keys/airburst/) rather than to this setting.

:::danger[A splitting projectile with no `AirburstWeapon` crashes the game]
The split reads the named weapon's projectile without first checking that a weapon was named, so the game crashes the moment such a projectile detonates. Because the stored value comes from [`Airburst`](/keys/airburst/), this reaches any projectile marked `Airburst=yes` that does not also name a weapon.

:::caution[A later rules file resets this key]
The default handed to the read is the `Airburst` flag, not the value this key already holds, so every later rules layer that carries the projectile's section — for any key at all — overwrites this setting with whatever `Airburst` stands at. `Splits=no` on an `Airburst=yes` projectile must be repeated in every file that declares the section.
