The timer is reloaded with this many frames after every [growth pass](/systems/tiberium/#growth), whether or not any cell ripened, and `0` gives the type a pass on every frame. [`TiberiumGrows=yes`](/keys/tiberiumgrows/#scope-scenarios) multiplies the reloaded figure by `0.3`; nothing else scales it.

A scenario with [`TiberiumGrowthEnabled=no`](/keys/tiberiumgrowthenabled/) runs no pass at all, so the delay is never consulted there.
