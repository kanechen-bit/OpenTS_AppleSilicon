Only the set's first tile is used, as the unbroken crystal that [`ClearToCrystalLat`](/keys/cleartocrystallat/) blends against and the tile a crystal cell reverts to when crystal surrounds it.

Crystal is a mutated-biome feature of the random map generator, which maps to the temperate theater: the generator floods a spread of cells with this tile, then makes up to five random draws among those cells, dressing each drawn cell that is still plain crystal — and not reserved for something else — with a crystal terrain object.
