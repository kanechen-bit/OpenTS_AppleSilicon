The sound plays where a thrown animation ends its life, unless that end comes low over water, where only the splash is heard. It is tested on its own rather than inside the [`ExpireAnim`](/keys/expireanim/#scope-animtype) branch that carries the blast damage, so an animation with no impact animation still plays it.

A value naming no registered sound leaves whatever was set before in place.
