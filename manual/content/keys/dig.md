A tunneling vehicle creates the animation at its own position at three points in a trip: when it has finished turning to face its destination and starts to dig in, when the nose-down rotation completes and the descent begins, and when it rises back to within fifty leptons of ground level on the way out. Each of the three also plays [`DigSound`](/keys/digsound/).

A fourth point can play the sound alone. When a vehicle arrives beneath its destination in a cell it cannot enter, or one outside the local radar, it starts to rise there rather than looking for another spot, and plays the sound without an animation — but only if it is already within fifty leptons of ground level, which a burrowing vehicle is not.

:::danger[An unset animation crashes the game at the first burrow]
The animation is created without first checking that one was named, so with the key unset the game crashes as soon as a subterranean vehicle is given somewhere to go.
