Entries run hardest game setting first, and a computer house indexes them with its own difficulty slot, which is the inverse of the setting the player chose. The count is the house's own running total of live defensive teams, and the comparison is skipped entirely when [`UseMinDefenseRule=no`](/keys/usemindefenserule/). Below the entry, [only a defensive trigger passes](/systems/ai-team-production/#defensive-teams-and-the-enemy); a house with no defensive trigger it can spring therefore raises nothing at all until defensive teams reach it some other way.
