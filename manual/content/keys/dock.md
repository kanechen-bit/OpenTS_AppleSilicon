A harvester keeps its harvest mission only while its house owns at least one building of a listed type; with none owned, or with an empty list, it is switched to guard. When a load is ready it asks each listed type in turn for a bay among its own house's buildings and takes the first type that answers, so list order decides which kind of building is tried first. Allied buildings are not considered.
