A bridge cell that is destroyed kills everything on the deck, drops everything hanging beneath it, and then on a ninety-five percent roll shows one entry chosen at random from this list. It is placed at deck height over the cell, thrown up to twenty-five leptons off center in each direction, and held back one to five frames before it starts, so a long span coming down produces a ragged run of blasts rather than a single flash.

[`MetallicDebris`](/keys/metallicdebris/) covers the wreckage thrown alongside it on an even chance.

:::caution[An empty list also suppresses the wreckage]
This is one of the few animation lists the engine checks the length of, so leaving it empty is silent rather than fatal. The check gates the whole branch, though — the metallic debris is thrown inside it — so a bridge that has no explosion to show throws no wreckage either.
