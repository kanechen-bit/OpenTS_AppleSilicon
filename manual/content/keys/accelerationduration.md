A thrust sets a counter to this figure and spends one of it per frame, adding [`Acceleration`](/keys/acceleration/#scope-levitation-controls) to the unit's velocity each time. When the counter reaches zero the unit stops pushing and starts to coast. Frames run fifteen to the second, so the stock twenty carry a thrust for a little over a second.

A thrust in progress is cut short only by the target or destination it is aimed at coming within [`ProximityDistance`](/keys/proximitydistance/); reaching a mood's speed figure does not end it. A figure of `0` ends the thrust on the frame it began, leaving only the [`InitialBoost`](/keys/initialboost/) behind.

:::caution[A negative figure leaves a wandering unit adrift]
The counter is spent only while it stands above zero and the coast begins only when it is exactly zero, so a negative figure leaves the unit in a thrust it never finishes. It adds no speed, coasts to a standstill under [`Drag`](/keys/drag/), and — with nothing to steer at, and so nothing that can come within proximity — never returns to rest or reclaims its cell.

[`Drag`](/keys/drag/) covers which objects read this section and the `[General]` section a file must carry for any of it to be read at all.
