No code reads the stored value, and nothing falls back to it. A storm's length comes only from the number carried by the [Ion Storm start...](/mapping/actions/taction-ion-storm-start/) trigger action or the [Ion storm start in...](/mapping/missions/tmission-ion-storm-start/) team mission.

[`IonStormWarning`](/keys/ionstormwarning/) in the same section is the ion storm timing value the engine does read.
