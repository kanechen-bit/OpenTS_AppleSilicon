BurstDelay2=6 ; six frames between the third shot and the fourth
```

The value is the reload delay the firing object is given once its third shot of a burst has gone off, in game frames. `-1` asks for a random three to five frames instead, and the assignment is reached only on a weapon whose [`Burst`](/keys/burst/) is above `3`; at a burst of exactly three the third shot is the last one and pays [`ROF`](/keys/rof/).

The gap is taken as written, without the house rate-of-fire bias, the random padding or the veteran rate-of-fire ability that the burst's closing [`ROF`](/keys/rof/) is subject to. [`Burst`](/keys/burst/) covers how the shots of a burst are counted and which weapons ignore the short gap altogether.
