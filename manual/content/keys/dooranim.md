The value is a filename without its extension, and only a non-empty value is taken. The named `<value>.SHP` is loaded with the rules, after the name has been rewritten for the scenario theater on the structure-art convention: a name beginning `GA`, `GT`, `NA`, `NT`, `CA` or `CT`, compared without regard to case, has its second letter replaced with `T` in temperate and `A` in snow. It is fetched again, under the theater then in force, when a saved game is restored, and on a [`NewTheater=yes`](/keys/newtheater/) type as each theater is set up.

The shape is drawn only while the structure is unloading — the sequence a [`WeaponsFactory=yes`](/keys/weaponsfactory/) structure runs while a finished vehicle leaves — and in the pass that draws over the structure, so it covers both the structure and the vehicle standing in the doorway. [`DoorStages`](/keys/doorstages/) covers which frame the door's progress selects.

```ini title="art.ini"
[MYWEAP] ; example war factory, drawn from its own Image ID
DoorAnim=GAWEAP_D  ; loaded as GTWEAP_D.SHP in temperate
DoorStages=9
UnderDoorAnim=GAWEAP_1
```

Its depth bias is a fixed five pixels toward the viewer, and it is drawn at the cell's own lighting level, so [`ExtraLight`](/keys/extralight/) does not reach it.
