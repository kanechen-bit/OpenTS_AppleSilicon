Without it a team recruits only until it starts moving, and losses are never made good. With it a team that is short of full strength keeps [looking for members](/systems/ai-team-production/#recruitment) for the rest of its life, and it keeps asking the house's production for the ones it is missing. A team of any other type counts toward that demand only until it is forced active, reaches full strength, or is set in motion.

The setting also decides whether a team can ever be pulled back off its Script. A `Reinforce=no` team stops counting as under strength the moment it first reaches full strength or is set in motion, and stays that way however many members it afterward loses; since the step that sends a team back to regroup is reached only by a team that is under strength, such a team is never sent back. A `Reinforce=yes` team falls under strength again once it is down to a third of its roster or fewer — or, where its roster asks for two members or one, as soon as it is short of full — and is then stopped and sent to gather. That is worth setting deliberately rather than for the recruiting alone, because [a regroup rewinds the team's Script to its first line](/systems/ai-team-execution/#every-regroup-rewinds-the-script).
