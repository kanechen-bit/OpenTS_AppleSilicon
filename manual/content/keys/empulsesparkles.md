The animation is attached to every vehicle, aircraft and infantryman [a pulse stuns](/systems/emp-pulse/#what-a-pulse-reaches), and to a stunned structure that is the deployed form of a vehicle, each starting after a random delay of up to 25 frames; any other stunned structure receives none. Its length is its own, so it may finish well before the stun does, and on recovery the engine only tells a still-running copy to stop after its current loop.

:::danger[The animation is created without checking that one is named]
Every stun that attaches an animation reads this type. With no type named here the game crashes the first time a pulse stuns one of the objects above.
