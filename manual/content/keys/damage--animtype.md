Accumulates frame by frame while the animation plays and is dealt in whole points at the animation's position with the [`FlameDamage2`](/keys/flamedamage2/) warhead — [`C4Warhead`](/keys/c4warhead/) for the animation named `INVISO` — five times as fast when the animation sits on a terrain object. A bouncing animation instead deals the figure with its own [`Warhead`](/keys/warhead/) to each object within [`DamageRadius`](/keys/damageradius/) of an impact.
