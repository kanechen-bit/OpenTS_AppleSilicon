key: MinDamage
summary: The smallest damage a warhead may deal to a target close to the impact.

  kind: value
  value: "1"

Damage is scaled by the warhead's [`Verses`](/keys/verses/) percentage against the target's armor and then divided by distance from the impact. This value is the floor the result is raised to, but only while that divisor is below 4 — past that the shot is allowed to fall away to nothing. The figure is then capped by [`MaxDamage`](/keys/maxdamage/).

:::caution[The floor also lifts the low-power damage tick]
The [structure damage tick](/systems/power/#the-structure-damage-tick) enters this path with a raw damage of 1 and an impact distance of zero, so it comes out at whatever this value holds. Setting it to 10 makes a shortfall cost ten strength per tick instead of one.
