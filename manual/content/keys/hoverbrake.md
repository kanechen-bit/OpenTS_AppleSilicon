The mirror of [`HoverAcceleration`](/keys/hoveracceleration/), and like it a length of time rather than a rate. Each frame the drive lowers the throttle by `1 ÷ (HoverBrake × 900)` of full and floors it at nothing, so at 900 frames to the minute the stock `.03` closes a fully open throttle over 27 frames, a little under two seconds.

The braking runs whenever the ceiling has fallen below the throttle the unit is carrying. That happens once the unit comes within a cell of its destination, where the ceiling factor is halved before [`HoverBoost`](/keys/hoverboost/) multiplies it — so the stock `150%` leaves a ceiling of three quarters — and it happens outright, the ceiling dropping to nothing, while the drive has no power or the unit is pointed more than 45 degrees away from its next stop. For a hover unit having no power here means it has also settled onto the ground. A unit that has just been shoved aside keeps a ceiling whatever its power and facing.
