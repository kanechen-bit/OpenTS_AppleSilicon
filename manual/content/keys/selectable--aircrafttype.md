Clearing the flag closes every route into a selection. The cursor over the object never becomes the select cursor and a click on it selects nothing, a band box drawn across it passes it by, and cycling forward or backward through the army steps over it. The power-toggle cursor also refuses it.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MYPROP] ; a BuildingType placed as scenery
Selectable=no
```

A building carries a further condition of its own: even while selectable, a band box takes it in only when it undeploys into a unit and is not a construction yard. A single click still selects it.
