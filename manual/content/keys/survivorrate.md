The count is the structure's cost multiplied by this fraction and divided by [`SurvivorDivisor`](/keys/survivordivisor/), then clamped to between 1 and 5, so the setting can only move a structure inside that band. It is read on destruction and on a sale alike, and only for a [`Crewed=yes`](/keys/crewed/) type. [Survivors](/systems/capture/#survivors) covers the per-cell odds a destroyed structure rolls the count against, and what a capture and an armed demolition charge do to them.
