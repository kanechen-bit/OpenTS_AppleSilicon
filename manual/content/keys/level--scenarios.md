  note: The engine starts each scenario with about a sixtieth of full light here, but the fallback used when the key is absent divides two whole numbers and truncates to zero, so an omitted key stores zero rather than that fraction.

Cell brightness is the ambient level, plus this figure for each height level the cell stands above the ground, minus [`Ground`](/keys/ground/). The same figure also scales the height bonus drawn onto aircraft and onto elevated units and infantry. At `0` the map is shaded flat, with no cliff or hill standing out from the ground around it.

[`IonLevel`](/keys/ionlevel/) replaces this value for the length of [an ion storm](/systems/ion-storms/#lighting), and it truncates on omission in the same way.
