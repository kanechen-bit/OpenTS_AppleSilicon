The flag moves the building's dock point half a cell east of its center, plays the production animation once a docked harvester has emptied itself, and keeps an idle harvester from parking on the building by sending it to a cell beside it.

Admitting a harvester in the first place is [`DockUnload=yes`](/keys/dockunload/), and storing what it brings is [`Storage`](/keys/storage/); neither follows from this flag.
