The value is a color scheme name, matched against the loaded schemes without regard to letter case. A scheme carrying only one intensity level is skipped during that match, and a name matching no remaining scheme leaves the country on the scheme it already had.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[GDI]
Color=Gold
```

Each house takes this scheme as it is created and recolors everything it owns with it. Two things then move it. A campaign scenario may override the house's copy with a [`Color=`](/keys/color/#scope-house-per-scenario) in its own house record, which leaves the country's copy alone. A skirmish or multiplayer game overwrites *both* copies with the color the player picked in the lobby, so the country's own setting survives only into a campaign.

That second overwrite is why the country's copy is worth knowing about at all: several places color their text from the country rather than from the house — the ally, defeat and connection messages among them — and in a lobby game those follow whichever house of that country was set up last.
