A damaged instance of a type marked this way runs the same [base defense response](/systems/base-attacked/#calling-defenders-back) a damaged structure runs, sized from the attacker's [`ThreatPosed`](/keys/threatposed/) and answered by the house's infantry and vehicles. The setting is read only for a computer house; a human house's protected object is on its own.

```ini title="rules.ini"

:::caution[The call goes out only on ordinary damage]
The result of the hit decides which branch of the damage routine runs, and this one is reached only when the hit changed none of the object's damage states. A protected infantry, vehicle or aircraft stays silent on the hit that takes it below half strength, on the hit that takes it into condition red, and on the killing blow — the states worth calling for help about are the ones that never reach it. A structure is not affected: it calls for help on every hit from an attacking object regardless of result.
