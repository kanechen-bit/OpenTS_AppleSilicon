[The damaged form](/systems/building-animations/#the-damaged-form) covers when a slot picks this name over [`SpecialAnim`](/keys/specialanim/). A depot and a storage structure both ask for the healthy name as they [fill a special slot](/keys/specialanim/#what-starts-a-special-animation), so this one is reached as the structure crosses the damage threshold with the animation already running, rather than at the moment the slot is filled.
