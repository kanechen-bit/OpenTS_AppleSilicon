The fraction is applied to the same price the house would have paid for the type — its [`Cost=`](/keys/cost/#scope-aircrafttype) after the [country price multiplier](/keys/cost/#scope-housetype) and the [difficulty section's own multiplier](/keys/cost/#scope-difficulty-settings) folded into it — and the product is truncated to whole credits. Current strength never enters into it, so a structure one point from destruction sells for what an undamaged one does.

Only a house a human is playing takes the reduction: in a campaign a house the local player controls — its own, and any the scenario marks [`PlayerControl=yes`](/keys/playercontrol/) — and in every other game a house with a human behind it. Every computer house is refunded the full price instead.

Four paths pay through it: selling a structure, [selling a vehicle or aircraft at a service depot](/systems/repair/#selling-at-the-pad), the upgrade handed back when a structure carrying one is sold, and the compensation paid when a construction yard undeploys and its MCV cannot be placed anywhere. Canceling something still under construction is a different figure and [refunds what has been paid so far](/systems/production/#paying-for-it) in full.
