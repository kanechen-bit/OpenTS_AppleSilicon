An animation carrying [`TiberiumChainReaction=yes`](/keys/tiberiumchainreaction/) clears the Tiberium in the cell it occupies, and one time in three it also creates one entry of this list, picked at random, ten leptons above the cell and recolored through the type's [`Color`](/keys/color/#scope-tiberium). That is the only path that reads the list; an empty list simply leaves nothing behind.
