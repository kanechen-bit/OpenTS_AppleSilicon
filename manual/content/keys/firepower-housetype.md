A projectile an object of this country's house fires from a weapon has the weapon's [`Damage`](/keys/damage/#scope-weapontype) multiplied by this value, so a figure above 1 hits harder. Projectiles created outside that firing path — a nuke silo's launch, either kind of EM pulse, a superweapon, a trigger action, and a bullet splitting into more — carry their own damage and are never scaled. The product is worked out once, when the house is [given its difficulty slot](/systems/difficulty/#how-the-figures-are-combined), and not per shot.

A campaign game drops the country's contribution, so this value shapes skirmish and multiplayer games only; the difficulty section's own [`FirePower=`](/keys/firepower-difficulty-settings/) applies in both.
