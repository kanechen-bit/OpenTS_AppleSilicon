A comma-separated list of ability tokens, matched without regard to letter case and parsed exactly like [`VeteranAbilities`](/keys/veteranabilities/), including the whitespace and length limits described there. The list is consulted only at elite rank: a veteran of the same type gets nothing from it, and an elite holds the union of both lists. [The ability table](/systems/veterancy/#abilities) lists the eighteen accepted tokens and what each one does.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MYTANK] ; example UnitType
VeteranAbilities=FIREPOWER
EliteAbilities=ROF,SELF_HEAL
```

An elite `MYTANK` fires harder, reloads faster, and repairs itself; a veteran one only fires harder.
