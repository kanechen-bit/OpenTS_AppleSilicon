key: Buildup
summary: The construction animation file a structure plays while it is being built.
see_also: ["BuildupTime", "DemandLoadBuildup", "FreeBuildup", "GateStages", "Unsellable", "system:production"]
when_omitted:
  kind: value
  value: ""
  note: The type has no construction artwork.

The value is a filename without its extension. Only a non-empty value is taken and only the first 15 characters of it are kept; the named `<value>.SHP` is loaded with the rules, after the name has been rewritten for the scenario theater on the structure-art convention that [`DoorAnim`](/keys/dooranim/) describes.

The file supplies both the frames of the construction animation and its length. Half the frames in the file are the step count — [`GateStages`](/keys/gatestages/) plus one for a [`Gate=yes`](/keys/gate/) type — and [`BuildupTime`](/keys/builduptime/) is divided by that count to give the delay between one step and the next. [Buildup](/systems/production/#buildup) covers what happens around the animation while it runs.

## A type with no construction artwork cannot be sold

Each structure asks its type for the construction artwork as it is created, and records the answer. A type that has none — no value here, or a value naming a file that is not there — leaves every structure of that type with no answer to record, and the sale is then refused however it is reached: the sell cursor, a trigger, and the computer's own emergency sell-off all pass through the same gate. [Capture](/systems/capture/) covers what a captured structure of such a type does instead. [`Unsellable=yes`](/keys/unsellable/) is the deliberate refusal, and it is the weaker one — the computer's sell-off and the trigger action both bypass that flag, and neither bypasses this gate.

The same answer decides one other thing: only a structure whose type has construction artwork turns a [`Nominal=yes`](/keys/nominal/) survivor into a technician as it is destroyed or sold.

:::caution[A theater-specific structure is timed differently]
A [`Theater=yes`](/keys/theater/) structure has its construction artwork fetched again as the theater is set up, this time under the theater's own extension rather than `.SHP`. That path counts every frame in the file as a step and fixes the delay at five seconds divided by that count, so `BuildupTime` does not reach it and neither does the halving above.
