The projectile's shape steps forward one frame at a time and returns to [`AnimLow`](/keys/animlow/) once it passes this one. The pair fixes the loop and [`AnimRate`](/keys/animrate/) fixes how fast it runs.

The animation runs at all only while one of the two frame numbers is other than `0`. With both left at `0` the shape is picked from the projectile's heading instead, which is what [`Rotates`](/keys/rotates/) controls; with either set, the animation frame is drawn and the heading is never consulted.

A new projectile always starts on frame `0` rather than on `AnimLow`, so its first pass runs from the beginning of the artwork and only later passes are confined to the loop.

```ini title="art.ini"
[MYFLAREART] ; the Image ID that the projectile's Image assignment names
AnimPalette=yes
AnimLow=0
AnimHigh=5 ; six frames, restarting at the first
AnimRate=1
```

The figure is stored in a single byte, so `256` stores as zero and anything above `255` wraps around.

The setting is read from the art section named by the projectile's [`Image`](/keys/image/). That assignment is required. Without it the lookup runs against an empty section name, so nothing here is read — not even from an art section named after the projectile, which is where its [`Voxel`](/keys/voxel/) setting is still found.
