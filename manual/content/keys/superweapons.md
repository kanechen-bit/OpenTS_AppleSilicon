The threshold is consulted only in a campaign game, where a computer house takes its [`IQ`](/keys/iq/) from its own scenario section and starts at 0. Outside a campaign the check is bypassed entirely, so every computer house fires its superweapons whatever its intelligence level says.

The gate covers the whole [superweapon step of the computer's decision pass](/systems/superweapons/#the-computers-use), so raising it above the intelligence a campaign grants leaves the house charging weapons it never fires.
