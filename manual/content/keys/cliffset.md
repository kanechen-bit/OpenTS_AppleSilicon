key: CliffSet
summary: Tile set holding the theater's forty cliff faces.

  kind: value
  value: "-1"
  note: The role stays unresolved, because no tile set number can match it, and the generator's tile-level cliff test then answers yes for the theater's first thirty-nine tiles.

The forty pieces are ordered by shape, and every cliff decision is written as a distance from the first of them. The random map generator's cliff pass turns the pattern of high ground around a cell into one of those shape numbers and stamps the piece that shape names; it also recognizes a cliff by testing whether a tile falls in the forty places from here, and reads the crystal-cliff shapes as a distance from this same role. [Theater control files](/formats/theater-control/) explains how a `[General]` role is resolved to a live tile index.

Every path that reads the role belongs to random map generation. A cliff placed on a hand-authored map still stops movement, because that comes from the land type the cliff artwork itself carries rather than from this setting.

:::danger[An unresolved role is used as a tile index anyway]
The cliff pass indexes the tile heap directly with this role plus the shape it chose, without first testing that the role resolved. With the role unresolved every placement lands two tiles below where its shape number points, and the first of the forty shapes indexes the heap at `-1`. Leaving this role out while [`CrystalCliff`](/keys/crystalcliff/) resolves is worse: the crystal substitution then derives its shape by subtracting an unresolved figure, and the fixed table of forty shape offsets is read past its end by however large the crystal role's own index is.
