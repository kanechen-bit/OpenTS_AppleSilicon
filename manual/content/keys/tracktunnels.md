The four pieces build a tunnel exactly as the road mouths do, and [`Tunnels`](/keys/tunnels/) covers what that means and how the facing is read off a piece's place in the set. This role is tested second of the four, so a tile that also falls inside the road tunnel set is claimed by that one instead.
