The value is given in cells, with fractions accepted, and sets the limit of the outward ring search, so the default reaches 31 cells from the harvester. It applies when a harvester sets out with no recorded patch to return to; failing that search is what leaves the harvester idle and marks its house short of Tiberium. The same figure bounds a [weeder's](/systems/veins/) search for veins.
