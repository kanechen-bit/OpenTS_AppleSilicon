Leptons per frame: 256 leptons to a cell, 15 frames to the second. The two horizontal components of a thrown animation's launch velocity are drawn independently, each a whole number taken from twice this figure and then shifted down by it. A whole-number setting therefore gives speeds from minus the setting up to one lepton per frame short of it, in either axis, so the positive extreme is never reached.

A meteor draws both components from the same range and then mirrors the pair whenever `X` falls below `-Y`, which is what confines its approach to one half of the compass.

:::danger[A small setting stops the game]
The pick divides by the truncated whole number of twice this figure, so any value between `-0.5` and `0.5` — `0` among them — makes that divisor zero. The division faults, and the game stops the moment a [`Bouncer=yes`](/keys/bouncer/) or [`IsMeteor=yes`](/keys/ismeteor/#scope-animtype) animation of the type is created. An animation that is neither never makes the pick and is unaffected.
