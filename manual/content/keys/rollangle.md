key: RollAngle
summary: The angle in degrees an aircraft banks by while it is turning.

  value: "30"

The value is written in degrees and converted to radians as it is read. The fly locomotor banks the aircraft by the angle while its facing is rotating — one way for a clockwise turn and the other for a counter-clockwise one — and only while the aircraft is off the ground and its throttle is above [`PitchSpeed`](/keys/pitchspeed/). It levels out again the moment the turn finishes.

An [`IsDropship=yes`](/keys/isdropship/) type never banks, and neither does an aircraft that has been rocked by a nearby jolt, which is tilted sideways by the jolt instead.

:::caution[Writing `-1` is the same as leaving the key out]
The read uses `-1` as its own marker for a missing key, so `RollAngle=-1` leaves the stored 30 degrees in place. Write `RollAngle=0` to make a type turn flat.
