The sound is played from the structure's own position, once, on the pass that tears the structure down — after its cargo has been killed and its cloak generator or laser fence links have been shut off, and before the scorch marks, debris and survivors are placed. One sound covers every structure however large, and it is independent of the explosion animations the type names for itself.

Two paths reach that sequence: a structure damaged to destruction, and an [`IsLimpetMine=yes`](/keys/islimpetmine/) structure caught in an [EM pulse](/systems/emp-pulse/), which is destroyed outright rather than stunned. Selling a structure does not — the build-down runs its own sequence and takes [`SellSound`](/keys/sellsound/) instead.
