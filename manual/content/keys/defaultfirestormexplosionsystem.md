Between seven and nine of these systems are created at the victim's center, each told to send its sparks in a random direction. The branch is chosen by the killing warhead being exactly the one [`FirestormWarhead`](/keys/firestormwarhead/) names, and it replaces the explosion the victim would otherwise have produced — an aircraft's [`Explosion`](/keys/explosion/) list, and a unit's ordinary explosion or water splash. A unit whose art declares [`DeathFrames`](/keys/deathframes/) plays that death sequence instead and never reaches this branch.
