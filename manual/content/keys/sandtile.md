Only the set's first tile is used, as the unbroken sand that [`ClearToSandLat`](/keys/cleartosandlat/) blends against and the tile a sand cell reverts to when it is surrounded by sand.

The random map generator paints it in patches on desert maps; the temperate and mutated weights are zero, so it never fires there. On tundra and taiga maps the same per-cell sand chance is spent on [`Rocks`](/keys/rocks/) instead, so a snow theater never needs this set for generated terrain.
