No part of target scoring reads this figure; it is what an object is worth as a danger, not what it is worth as a target. Three systems consume it:

- The weight an object carries when a team tallies its members. Separately, this figure plus the type's [`Points`](/keys/points/) — and the same sum for anything carried as cargo — forms an object's worth to the computer, which nothing in the engine goes on to consult.
- The per-house, per-region threat map, credited when the object is placed on the map and debited when it leaves. The pathfinder reads that map through [`ThreatAvoidanceCoefficient`](/keys/threatavoidancecoefficient/).
- The size of a computer house's response when its base is attacked: the attacker's figure multiplied by [`ComputerBaseDefenseResponse`](/keys/computerbasedefenseresponse/) is the defensive strength the house tries to assemble.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MYTANK] ; example UnitType
ThreatPosed=25
```

A type left at `0` contributes nothing to any of the three, so an attacker of that type provokes no base-defense call-up at all.
