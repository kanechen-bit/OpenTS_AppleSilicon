The value is multiplied by 100 to give the step in the same hundredths [`Ambient`](/keys/ambient/) is stored in, so `.1` moves the level by ten hundredths each time. Steps are clamped at the target, so a fade never overshoots and the last step is whatever remains.

Every completed step raises the flag that admits the [Ambient light <= ...](/mapping/events/tevent-ambient-less-than/) and [Ambient light >= ...](/mapping/events/tevent-ambient-greater-than/) trigger events to that frame's evaluation, so those events are only ever tested while a fade is actually stepping.

The [Set ambient step...](/mapping/actions/taction-set-ambient-step/) trigger action overwrites this value in the loaded rules, and the overwrite outlives the trigger that made it.
