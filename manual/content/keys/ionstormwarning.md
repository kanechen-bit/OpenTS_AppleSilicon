Both scripted ways of starting a storm pass this figure as the countdown, so it applies to every storm a scenario raises. The countdown runs down one frame at a time, and every fifteen seconds of it the EVA approach line plays with a ten-second on-screen message; a value of `31` therefore produces two announcements, 30 and 15 seconds out.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[General]
IonStormWarning=31
```

At `0` the storm breaks on the frame its trigger action or team mission runs, with no approach warning — only the break's own on-screen message shows. [The warning](/systems/ion-storms/#the-warning) covers what happens when a second storm is ordered while a countdown is already running.
