The name promises control over whether an enemy object shows a condition bar. One test remains: the decorations drawn for a selected or sensor-detected structure or core defender check the flag alongside whether the object's house is allied to the player, and on either count call the routine that used to draw the old-style health bar. That routine survives as an empty body and draws nothing.

The condition indicator the game actually draws is put up once that block has closed, for every selected or sensor-detected object rather than only for structures and core defenders, with no ownership test and no reference to the flag, so such an object shows its condition whoever owns it and whatever the setting says. The object under the mouse pointer shows its condition on the same terms, limited to what the pointer may resolve at all. A structure draws the pip bar it would draw for a selection. Anything else draws bare condition pips, without the select graphic that frames them and boxes the object while it is selected. A second pair of tests on the same flag sits in an older drawing routine that is compiled out.
