The movie is the last one a won mission plays. It runs after [`PostScore`](/keys/postscore/) and before the campaign decides where to go next, and it plays even when that decision skips the map selection screen or ends the game — [`OneTimeOnly`](/keys/onetimeonly/) and [`EndOfGame`](/keys/endofgame/) are both tested afterwards.

[`Intro`](/keys/intro/) covers how a movie name is resolved and what happens to one that cannot be found.
