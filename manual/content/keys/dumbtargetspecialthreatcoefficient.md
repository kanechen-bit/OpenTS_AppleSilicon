Threat scoring reads five coefficients from the type of the object doing the choosing. This house-wide set was meant to replace all five for a house that owns no threat rating structure, and the two sets are all-or-nothing — there is no per-coefficient fallback between them. Every house has the threat rating flag set as it is created and nothing ever clears it, so the substitution never happens and [`TargetSpecialThreatCoefficient`](/keys/targetspecialthreatcoefficient/) is always the value used.
