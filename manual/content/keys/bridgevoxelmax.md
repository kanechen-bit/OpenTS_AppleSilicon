Nothing bounds the debris a collapsing bridge throws. Each cell of a falling section draws its own, and only while [`BridgeExplosions`](/keys/bridgeexplosions/) carries at least one entry: nineteen cells in twenty draw one animation from that list, and half of those draw one from [`MetallicDebris`](/keys/metallicdebris/) beside it.
