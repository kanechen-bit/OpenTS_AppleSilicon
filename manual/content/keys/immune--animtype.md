Nothing ever offers an animation to the damage step, so the flag is never tested for one; [`Strength`](/keys/strength/#scope-animtype) sets out every path that would have to reach it and why none does. Nothing removes an animation by damaging it either: one goes when its stages run out, or when whatever it was attached to goes.
