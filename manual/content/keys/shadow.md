The name promises control over the shadow drawn beneath a projectile in flight. That shadow is drawn under every shape-drawn projectile that is above the ground and under no [`Voxel=yes`](/keys/voxel/) projectile, and neither case consults this flag: `Shadow=no` removes nothing.

No gameplay or rendering path reads the stored flag.
