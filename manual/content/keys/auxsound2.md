Two unrelated paths read the same slot:

- A **structure** plays it at its own position as a deconstruction begins — a sale or an undeploy — once its animations have stopped and an [`IsJuggernaut=yes`](/keys/isjuggernaut/) structure has finished returning its body and barrel to their start values. The reverse build-up follows it; on a sale that puts out no vehicle, the crew evacuation comes between the two.
- An object flown by the [flyer locomotor](/keys/locomotor/) plays it once per landing, at the ground under it, as it drops below 300 leptons, and only while it still has strength left. A wreck falling out of the sky lands silently.

Nothing else reads the slot, so on a ground vehicle or an infantryman the setting is inert.

:::caution[A structure's `UndeploySound` wins]
[`UndeploySound`](/keys/undeploysound/) is stored in this same slot and is read afterward, so a BuildingType that sets both keeps only `UndeploySound`.
:::

A name that matches no registered sound leaves the previous value in place rather than clearing it.
