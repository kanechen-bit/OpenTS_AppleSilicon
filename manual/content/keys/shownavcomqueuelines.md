The lines continue from the end of the movement line through each destination queued with the queue-move key, in the order they will be traveled, and a looping queue draws a closed ring. With `no` only the movement line to the end of the current route is drawn. [Action lines](/systems/action-lines/) covers when the lines are drawn.
