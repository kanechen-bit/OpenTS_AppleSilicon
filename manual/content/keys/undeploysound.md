UndeploySound=COREUP1 ; a sound ID registered in SOUND.INI
```

A structure plays this at its own position as a deconstruction begins — a sale or an undeploy — once its animations have stopped and, for an [`IsJuggernaut=yes`](/keys/isjuggernaut/) structure, once its body and barrel have returned to [`StartFacing`](/keys/startfacing/) and [`StartPitch`](/keys/startpitch/). The reverse build-up follows it, so this is the opening sound of a sale rather than its closing one. The crew evacuation and the [`SellSound`](/keys/sellsound/) come after it too, but a structure with an [`UndeploysInto`](/keys/undeploysinto/) vehicle — the usual holder of this key — puts out no crew and plays no `SellSound` at all.

:::caution[It replaces `AuxSound2`]
The key stores into the same slot as [`AuxSound2`](/keys/auxsound2/) and is read after it, so a BuildingType that sets both keeps only this one. A name that matches no registered sound leaves the slot alone rather than clearing it.
