The named type is counted across the house's standing structures when a structure offers this weapon [through its own `SuperWeapon=` or `SuperWeapon2=`](/systems/superweapons/#from-a-structure-or-a-plug). A count of zero withholds the weapon, and losing the last one takes it away again. The stock chem missile names the Nod waste facility this way.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[ChemicalSpecial]
Type=ChemMissile
AuxBuilding=NAWAST   ; Nod Waste Facility
```

:::caution[A plug is never checked against this value]
The upgrade slots of a structure are matched straight against [`SuperWeapon=`](/keys/superweapon/) and [`SuperWeapon2=`](/keys/superweapon2/), skipping the test the structure's own grant goes through. A weapon supplied by a plug ignores this setting both when it is granted and when the removal pass decides whether to keep it. In the stock set the ion cannon and the drop pods arrive only through plugs; the hunter seeker also has a direct grant from the Nod temple, where this setting is tested normally.
