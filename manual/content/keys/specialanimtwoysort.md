The bias that moves the second special slot's animation within the drawing order of the objects sharing its layer. [Placement and draw order](/systems/building-animations/#placement-and-draw-order) covers how that differs from the depth bias, what the slot does to the AnimType's own sort bias, and the byte the figure has to fit in, and [`SpecialAnim`](/systems/building-animations/#where-each-setting-is-read-from) covers why it is not written in the same section as the slot's animation names.
