The system's working interval, which starts at [`SpawnFrames`](/keys/spawnframes/) and grows by [`Slowdown`](/keys/slowdown/) each frame, is measured against this figure at the end of every frame. Once it is past, the system stops emitting; it stays on the map until the last particle it already made has died, and then goes. Only the `Smoke` [behavior](/keys/behaveslike/#scope-particlesystemtype) reads it.

Set below the opening interval, the test is met on the system's very first frame, so the plume emits one particle and immediately begins winding down — which is what a type that carries neither setting gets. A plume that is meant to run needs a cutoff above `SpawnFrames`, and a non-zero `Slowdown` to reach it at all.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MySmokeSys] ; a ParticleSystemType registered in [ParticleSystems]
BehavesLike=Smoke
HoldsWhat=MySmokePuff ; a ParticleType registered in [Particles]
SpawnFrames=10
Slowdown=.0025
SpawnCutoff=15.0 ; reached after 2000 frames
```

This is the only retirement condition a smoke system has of its own; the alternative is a positive [`Lifetime`](/keys/lifetime/), which cuts the plume off wherever its interval happens to have reached.
