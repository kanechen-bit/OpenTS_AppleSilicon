The radar map is raised for the local player's house when no ion storm is running, its power output is at least its drain, and it owns a structure of a `Radar=yes` type that is switched on, out of limbo, on the map and not being deconstructed. A scenario set to [`FreeRadar=yes`](/keys/freeradar/) skips that search but still has to pass the storm and power tests.

:::caution[The search stops at the first radar it finds]
Buildings are scanned in creation order and the scan ends at the first eligible structure, which supplies the radar only if it is not stunned. A stunned radar found first therefore keeps the map dark even when a second, working one stands beside it.
:::

The value also marks the structure as an intelligence target. While the local player has a spy inside an enemy's `Radar=yes` structure, every reveal that enemy's objects make is credited to the local player instead, so the enemy's own sight of the map is shared out as it moves.
