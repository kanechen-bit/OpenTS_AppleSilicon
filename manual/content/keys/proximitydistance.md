The distance is written in cells and measured flat, between the unit's center and the point it is steering at; height is not taken into account. Inside it the unit stops using thrusts and moves at [`IntentionalDriftVelocity`](/keys/intentionaldriftvelocity/) instead, and a thrust or a coast already in progress is cut short and braked at [`IntentionalDeacceleration`](/keys/intentionaldeacceleration/).

Arriving is a separate and much tighter test: the unit stops dead, with all of its motion zeroed, once it is within half a cell of the point. This figure therefore sets the width of the band in which the unit creeps up on its objective, and anything at or below half a cell removes that band entirely.

The same figure is used for a target and for a destination alike, and it is the only thing that ends a coast when a mood's speed figure never fires.

[`Drag`](/keys/drag/) covers which objects read this section and the `[General]` section a file must carry for any of it to be read at all.
