The vehicle takes the harvest mission on its own, fills from cells of Tiberium up to its [`Storage`](/keys/storage/), and returns to a [`DockUnload=yes`](/keys/dockunload/) building drawn from its [`Dock`](/keys/dock/) list. [Harvesting](/systems/tiberium/#harvesting) covers the search, load, and unload cycle.

:::caution[The vein branch wins when both flags are set]
A type carrying both this flag and [`Weeder=yes`](/keys/weeder/#scope-unittype) waits for Tiberium ground the way a Tiberium harvester does, and then runs the vein branch on it: one or two units are added to the first Tiberium compartment per cycle and the cell keeps every stage it had.
