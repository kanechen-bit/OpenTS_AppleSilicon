Each shot the weapon fires carries this figure, scaled by the firer's firepower modifiers when the shot comes from ordinary combat, and the warhead then decides what the figure does on impact. An [`EMEffect=yes`](/keys/emeffect/) warhead never reaches damage processing at all and spends it as [the pulse duration in frames](/systems/emp-pulse/#firing-a-pulse) instead.

:::caution[The 155mm weapon ignores this outside campaigns]
Outside campaign games the weapon named `155mm` has this value overridden to a hard-coded `115`.
