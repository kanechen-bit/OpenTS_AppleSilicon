A house whose [`IQ`](/keys/iq/) reached this level would count the worth of a transport's passengers toward the transport's worth as a target, and so would a house whose [difficulty section](/keys/contentscan/#scope-difficulty-settings) sets the companion flag; the two are alternatives rather than conditions that both have to hold.

Neither is reached. The comparison sits inside the routine that puts a figure on an object as a target, and the only thing that calls that routine is the pass in which a computer house picks a building to aim a superweapon at — a pass nothing invokes. This is the one entry in `[IQ]` that raising a house's intelligence cannot switch on, and moving the threshold changes nothing at any level.
