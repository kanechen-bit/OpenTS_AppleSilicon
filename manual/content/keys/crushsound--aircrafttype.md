The sound is played by the crusher, at the crusher's position, on the single frame the victim is destroyed. It is read from the type being crushed, not from the vehicle doing the crushing, and it is the only sound either path plays — a crushed object and a flattened wall overlay both go quiet if their type names none.

Only a [`Crushable=yes`](/keys/crushable/#scope-aircrafttype) type ever reaches either path, so the setting is inert on anything a crusher cannot drive over.
