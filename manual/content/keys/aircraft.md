Aircraft are not replaced on their own account, and no intelligence level gates them. A computer house orders one through [the same demand tally that chooses its vehicles and infantry](/systems/ai-team-production/#production-demand), which counts the places its teams cannot fill and never consults the house's [`IQ`](/keys/iq/). The one replacement the intelligence scale really does gate is [`Harvester`](/keys/harvester/#scope-global-rules).
