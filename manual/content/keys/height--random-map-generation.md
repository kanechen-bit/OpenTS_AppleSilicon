  note: The read passes the current setting through, and the generator's settings outlive one map, so an omitted assignment keeps whatever the last map built in this session left behind.

The figure is a size index rather than a cell count. It is divided by three and used to interpolate the generated playable area's depth between a minimum and a maximum chosen by the player count, so `0` gives the smallest map for that many players and `3` the largest. At two players that range is 50 to 100 cells; it climbs with each further player, reaching 135 to 175 at eight. The generated map itself is twelve rows deeper than the playable area. [Map seed files](/formats/map-seed/) covers the section it is written in.

```ini title="map seed file"
[RandomMap]
NumPlayers=4
Height=3
```

The figure is held to `0` through `3` only on [the dialog path](/systems/map-generation/#the-dialog-path-and-the-scenario-path), so a figure written by hand in a seed file reaches the generator as it stands: a larger one extrapolates past the maximum and a negative one shrinks the map below the minimum.
