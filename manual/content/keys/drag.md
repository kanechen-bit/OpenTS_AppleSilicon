A levitating unit travels in bursts: it thrusts for a fixed number of frames, coasts, brakes to a stop, and thrusts again. This figure is the loss applied on every frame of that cycle except the braking one, where [`IntentionalDeacceleration`](/keys/intentionaldeacceleration/) takes over, and the drifting ones, where no loss is applied at all. It is subtracted from the unit's speed rather than scaling it, so the slowdown is a steady one and not a curve that tails off.

Once the loss is as large as the speed the unit is carrying, its motion is zeroed on the spot rather than reversed. A figure at or above the speed a thrust reaches therefore leaves the unit stationary between thrusts.

Speeds and losses in this section are in leptons per frame — 256 leptons to a cell, 15 frames to the second. A unit coasting at four leptons per frame comes to rest in eighty frames at a loss of a twentieth per frame, and in eight frames at a loss of a half.

The section governs only objects whose [`Locomotor`](/keys/locomotor/) is that identifier. Its values are held once for the whole game rather than per object, so a change to any of them moves every levitating object at once.

The whole section is read only from a file that also carries a `[General]` section: the read is made from inside the routine that handles `[General]`, and that routine returns without doing anything when the file has no such section. A map overriding any `[LEVITATION]` value must therefore carry a `[General]` section of its own, holding at least one assignment — a section with no entries in it is discarded as the file is read.
