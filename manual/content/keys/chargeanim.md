The flag does not make a structure charge. The weapon decides that: a [`Charges=yes`](/keys/charges/) primary weapon is what puts a structure through a charge-up before it may fire, and [`TurretChargeAnimRate`](/keys/turretchargeanimrate/) is how fast that charge runs.

What the flag does is let a structure with no turret take the paths written for one. A `ChargeAnim=yes` type has the animation named by [`TurretAnim=`](/keys/turretanim/) created for it, and has that animation's frame reset on every pass — from a charge counter the structure keeps apart from its artwork sequence, stepped at `TurretChargeAnimRate`, rather than from a facing, so the animation advances with the charge instead of pointing at a target.

The animation is created as the structure opens, unless the type sets [`TurretAnimIsVoxel=yes`](/keys/turretanimisvoxel/) or [`TurretAnimIsExclusive=yes`](/keys/turretanimisexclusive/). On either of those nothing is created at that moment and the animation appears only once the structure begins charging.

```ini title="art.ini"
[MYOBEL] ; example obelisk, drawn from its own Image ID
ChargeAnim=yes
```

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MYOBEL]
TurretAnim=MYOBEL_A ; the animation the charge counter drives
Primary=MyLaser     ; a Charges=yes WeaponType
```

Outside construction and deconstruction the structure's own artwork sequence is no longer restarted when it runs past its last frame, and the wrap no longer raises the signal that a queued mission may start. A structure carrying a weapon raises that signal on every pass it spends guarding regardless, so a queued mission is not held up by its absence.
