The value is added, not subtracted, so a weight is only driven down by a negative one. It joins the trigger's own [history term](/systems/ai-team-production/#the-track-record) and the result is held inside the minimum and maximum weight the trigger carries. A team records a failure whenever it dies without having reached the [Success](/mapping/missions/tmission-success/) mission in its script, whatever it achieved on the way.
