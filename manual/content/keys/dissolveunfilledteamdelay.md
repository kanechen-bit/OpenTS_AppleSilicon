The delay is counted from the frame the team was created and applies only outside a campaign game, where it is what clears away a team whose TaskForce the house never managed to fill. A team that has already reached full strength or been set in motion dissolves the moment it loses its last member, in every session type. Either dissolution is an ordinary team death, so it [records an outcome](/systems/ai-team-production/#the-track-record) against every AI trigger that names the team's type first.
