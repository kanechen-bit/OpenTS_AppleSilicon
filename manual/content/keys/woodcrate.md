Campaign crates are not drawn at random: the overlay determines the result outright, and this setting is the result for a crate whose overlay is the one named by [`WoodCrateImg`](/keys/woodcrateimg/). The value is one of the [crate result](/reference/enums/crate/) tokens. A value the engine does not recognize resolves to `Money` with no diagnostic, so a misspelled token is indistinguishable from writing `Money`.

Because the campaign lookup runs this test last, a rules file that names the same OverlayType in `WoodCrateImg` and [`CrateImg`](/keys/crateimg/) makes this setting the result for every campaign crate.
