This is the wandering mood: the unit has neither a target nor a destination and is coasting. While its speed is below this figure and no thrust is already running, it rolls [`AccelerationProbability`](/keys/accelerationprobability/) each frame for a fresh thrust in a random direction. Once its speed is at or above the figure the rolls stop and it simply coasts, so the figure is a soft ceiling on aimless drifting — the unit can still overshoot it, because a thrust already begun is never cut short by it.

A unit that has slowed below a hundredth of a lepton per frame with nothing to head for comes to rest and reclaims its cell instead, whatever this figure says.

The other two moods use their figures the other way about, as the speed at which a coast is abandoned rather than continued; [`MaxVelocityWhenFollowing`](/keys/maxvelocitywhenfollowing/) covers that.

[`Drag`](/keys/drag/) covers which objects read this section and the `[General]` section a file must carry for any of it to be read at all.
