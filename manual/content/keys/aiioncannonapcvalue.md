The test is on the vehicle type's [`Passengers`](/keys/passengers/) being above zero, whether or not it is carrying any at the time, and is the last of the three vehicle tests; anything else is rated a flat 2. Like every list in this family it is read at the firing house's own difficulty slot, and must carry one entry each for easy, normal and hard; a missing or short list is read past its end. The rating is consulted only while [the target's strength is at or below `IonCannonDamage`](/systems/superweapons/#the-computers-use) — a transport above that figure is left at 1.
