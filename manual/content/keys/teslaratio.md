No BuildingType is treated as a Tesla coil anywhere in the engine; what makes a structure behave like one is an electric primary weapon, which the charge-up looks for — not any flag on the building type. Defensive structures are picked by [the defense planner](/systems/ai-base-building/#base-defenses) from the anti-air, anti-armor and anti-infantry values each type is given as the types load.
