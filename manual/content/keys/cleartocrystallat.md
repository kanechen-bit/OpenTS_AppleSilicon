Crystal terrain blends by the rule [`ClearToRoughLat`](/keys/cleartoroughlat/) describes, against the single plain [`CrystalTile`](/keys/crystaltile/) ground tile, with one addition no other family has: four tiles of the crystal cliff set count as crystal on the half of the cliff that carries crystal. The cliff's first tile counts only for subtiles below 2 and its second only for subtiles from 2 up, while its fifth counts only on even subtiles and its sixth only on odd ones. A crystal field running up to a crystal cliff therefore blends into the rock face instead of stopping short of it.

Crystal is one of the four families that keep blending even when their set is unresolved, so a theater with crystal ground and no crystal LAT set misplaces tiles rather than leaving the ground alone.
