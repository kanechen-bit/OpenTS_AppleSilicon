Four separate firestorm tests read this flag: the sweep of a raised section's own cell, the sweep of the cells around it for anything walking toward it, the crossing test a flying object runs as it passes over a section, and the check a projectile makes on entering a section's cell. An exempt type is skipped by all four — [what a raised section destroys](/systems/laser-fences/#what-a-raised-section-destroys) covers the payload it is being spared.

Exemption is per type, not per object, and it does not extend to anything else the wall does. A projectile type whose flight is invisible is tested on a different path that does not read this flag, so it is consumed regardless. An exempt vehicle still cannot path through a raised section's cell, because the cell is impassable to movement whatever stands on it.

:::caution[A jumpjet is destroyed anyway]
The crossing test in the jumpjet locomotor does not read this flag at all, unlike the one used by ordinary flying objects. A jumpjet type carrying `IgnoresFirestorm=yes` is still destroyed when it moves onto a raised section's cell.
