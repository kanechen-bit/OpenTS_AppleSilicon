summary: The size of a spark system's burst, and the fullness a one-frame light's brightness is measured against.

Each burst a `Spark` system throws holds at least half this figure and never quite the whole of it: the count is half the figure plus a random amount up to one short of that half, so `12` gives a burst of six to eleven. A [`OneFrameLight`](/keys/oneframelight/) system of any behavior reads it a second way, dividing the particles it currently holds by this figure and drawing its glow at that fraction of [`LightSize`](/keys/lightsize/), with the fraction held between four tenths and the whole — so the light waxes as the system fills and never falls below the floor.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MySparkSys] ; a ParticleSystemType registered in [ParticleSystems]
BehavesLike=Spark
HoldsWhat=MySpark ; a ParticleType registered in [Particles]
ParticleCap=12 ; bursts of six to eleven
SparkSpawnFrames=1
SpawnSparkPercentage=1
```

Nothing enforces the figure as a limit. A system may hold any number of particles at once, and a `Smoke`, `Fire`, `Gas`, `Web` or `Railgun` system is not counted against it at all.

:::danger[A ParticleCap of 1, 0 or -1 crashes a spark system]
The burst size divides a random number by half the figure, and each of those three halves to zero. A `Spark` system carrying one of them crashes the game the first time it throws a burst.
