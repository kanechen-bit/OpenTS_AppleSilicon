Only the set's first tile is used. It is the unbroken rough ground that [`ClearToRoughLat`](/keys/cleartoroughlat/) blends against, and the tile a rough cell reverts to once all four of its orthogonal neighbors are rough as well.

The random map generator paints it in patches over clear ground, in every biome: on temperate and mutated maps it competes with [`GreenTile`](/keys/greentile/) and on desert with [`SandTile`](/keys/sandtile/), never with both at once, and on tundra and taiga maps it is the only ground scatter besides [`Rocks`](/keys/rocks/).
