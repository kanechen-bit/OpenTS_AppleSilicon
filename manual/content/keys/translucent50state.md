The second of the two fade states a [`Fire`](/keys/behaveslike/#scope-particletype) particle carries. [`Translucent25State`](/keys/translucent25state/) covers when the pair is tested, which states can never be matched, and what a `-1` means; the only difference here is the level reached and the order, since this one is applied after the quarter fade and wins if both name the same state.

Nothing forces the two into sequence. A flame whose half fade sits at an earlier state than its quarter fade thins to a half first and then back to a quarter, because each state simply sets the level it names.
