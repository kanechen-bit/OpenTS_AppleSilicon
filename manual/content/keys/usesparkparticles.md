One system of the type named in [`AttachedParticleSystem=`](/keys/attachedparticlesystem/) is spawned at the muzzle and aimed at the target as the shot leaves. Unlike a fire weapon, a spark weapon keeps its projectile's damage: [`Damage=`](/keys/damage/#scope-weapontype) is delivered on impact as usual and the spray is added on top of it.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MySparkGun] ; example WeaponType
UseSparkParticles=yes
AttachedParticleSystem=SparkSys ; a ParticleSystemType registered in [ParticleSystems]
ROF=30
```

A vehicle refuses the shot while it has anywhere to go. An infantry is held only by the ordinary bar on firing while actually in motion, so unlike a [`UseFireParticles=yes`](/keys/usefireparticles/) weapon this one may still be fired by a soldier standing still with a destination pending. Neither of the object's weapons may fire again while the spray is alive, and the reload delay is exactly [`ROF`](/keys/rof/), with the house's rate of fire bias, the burst gaps and the random padding all skipped. A structure with more than one round left waits a single frame instead, so only the effect's own lifetime paces it.

A weapon that also sets [`UseFireParticles=yes`](/keys/usefireparticles/) spawns the same particle system type twice over, once into each of the two holds, and must wait for both to burn out.

:::danger[A spark weapon with no particle system named crashes the game]
Nothing checks that [`AttachedParticleSystem=`](/keys/attachedparticlesystem/) resolved to anything before the spray is spawned, and the game stops the first time such a weapon fires.
