Every particle of the trace is placed this far out from the line between the muzzle and the target, at the angle [`SpiralDeltaPerCoord`](/keys/spiraldeltapercoord/) gives it, so the figure is the visible thickness of the corkscrew. It is in leptons, 256 to a cell, which puts the stock traces at `6` and `15` — a small fraction of a cell out from the beam. Only the `Railgun` [behavior](/keys/behaveslike/#scope-particlesystemtype) reads it.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MyRailgunSys] ; a ParticleSystemType registered in [ParticleSystems]
BehavesLike=Railgun
HoldsWhat=MyRailgunPart ; a ParticleType registered in [Particles]
SpiralRadius=15
SpiralDeltaPerCoord=.03
PositionPerturbationCoefficient=30
```

[`PositionPerturbationCoefficient`](/keys/positionperturbationcoefficient/) is applied on top and is measured in the same leptons, so a scatter set larger than this radius buries the coil in its own noise — which is what the stock traces do, and why they read as ragged streaks rather than as springs.
