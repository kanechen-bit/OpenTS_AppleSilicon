Every object a house of this country produces has its build time multiplied by this value, so a figure above 1 builds more slowly and one below 1 faster. The product is worked out once, when the house is given its difficulty slot, and not per order.

Outside campaign games this value, the [difficulty setting's own multiplier](/keys/buildtime/#scope-difficulty-settings) and [`GameSpeedBias`](/keys/gamespeedbias/) are multiplied together. In a campaign game the country's value is dropped and only the difficulty setting's multiplier and `GameSpeedBias` remain.
