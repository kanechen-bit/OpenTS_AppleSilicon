The second horizontal axis, and the counterpart of [`XVelocity`](/keys/xvelocity/), which covers how the three axis settings together fix a spark's speed and direction, what the holding system adds to them, and which behaviors read them. Setting the two horizontal axes apart makes a burst spread further along one of them than the other; the stock spark types keep them equal.

:::danger[Zero stops the game]
The random speed is drawn by dividing by this figure, so `YVelocity=0` divides by zero and the game stops the moment a spark system holding the type fires its first burst.
