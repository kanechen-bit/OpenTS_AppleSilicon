Every house, computer or human, is given a countdown as it is created: a random 450 to 1800 frames multiplied by this figure and truncated to a whole number. The countdown then runs down untouched. No gameplay path reads it, so raising or lowering the multiplier changes nothing about when a computer house first attacks; that follows from [the AI trigger pass](/systems/ai-team-production/#when-the-pass-runs) and the teams it raises.
