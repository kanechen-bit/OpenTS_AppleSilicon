An object caught in a raised wall section's own cell is dealt damage equal to its whole remaining strength through this warhead, forced and without a source, so armor and immunity do not save it and nothing is credited with the kill. The [approach sweep](/systems/laser-fences/#what-a-raised-section-destroys) beside it uses [`C4Warhead`](/keys/c4warhead/) instead, so the two paths do not share their impact effects.
