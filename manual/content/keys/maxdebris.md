A figure of zero turns wreckage off, and it is the first thing tested, so neither debris list is consulted at all. Above zero, the figure is a budget rather than a count, and which list it is spent on depends on whether the type declares [`DebrisTypes`](/keys/debristypes/) of its own:

- **With a list**, the budget is handed out along it in order — up to the matching [`DebrisMaximums`](/keys/debrismaximums/) figure from each entry, and only as far as the budget stretches — and every piece is created at the object's center, owned by the object's house. A budget larger than the sum of those figures simply goes unspent; the walk stops at the end of the list.
- **Without a list**, a count is drawn at random from zero up to the budget and that many [`[AudioVisual] MetallicDebris`](/keys/metallicdebris/) animations are created, each picked independently, twenty leptons above the object's center.

The wreckage is thrown before any [`Explodes=yes`](/keys/explodes/#scope-aircrafttype) blast and after the death voice. An object that lost its footing and fell, and then died within ten leptons of water, leaves the death path before either and throws nothing.
