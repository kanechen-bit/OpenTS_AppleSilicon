The name promises the tile set that stands in for this one while the alternate terrain artwork is displayed. The value is a tile-set number — the `NNNN` of a `[TileSetNNNN]` section — carried onto the tiles of the set and then resolved, once the whole file has been read, into the index of the matching tile in the named set: that set's first tile plus this tile's own position within its own set. Nothing reads the result. It reaches no draw, no substitution and no checksum, since the multiplayer synchronization checksum never visits the isometric tile types.

[`NonMarbleMadness`](/keys/nonmarblemadness/) is not the mirror of this key that its name suggests, and does have an effect.

:::caution[The resolution pass does not check the number]
Any value other than the omission marker is used directly as an index into the table of loaded tile sets, which holds 255 entries. A number above the sets the theater actually loaded reads a slot this theater never filled in, and a number of 255 or more reads past the table altogether.
