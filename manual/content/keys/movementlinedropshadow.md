The shadow is drawn first, in [`MovementLineDropShadowColor`](/keys/movementlinedropshadowcolor/), one row below the line, or two rows below a [thick](/keys/movementlinethick/) one, and the squares on the line's ends gain a border of the same colour. The movement line runs from a selected object to the end of its route; [Action lines](/systems/action-lines/) covers when it is drawn.
