The delay an object of a house of this country waits before its next shot is multiplied by this value. It multiplies the delay rather than the rate, so a figure above 1 fires more slowly. The product is worked out once, when the house is [given its difficulty slot](/systems/difficulty/#how-the-figures-are-combined), and not per shot.

A campaign game drops the country's contribution, so this value shapes skirmish and multiplayer games only; the [difficulty setting's own multiplier](/keys/rof/#scope-difficulty-settings) applies in both.
