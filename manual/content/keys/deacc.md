Subtracted from the particle's current speed once a frame, in the same leptons a frame the speed itself is measured in. Only two [behaviors](/keys/behaveslike/#scope-particletype) slow down: a `Fire` particle loses the figure every frame until its speed reaches zero, at which point it is flagged for death on the following frame, and a `Smoke` particle loses it only while it is still climbing faster than 3 leptons a frame, so a puff settles into a steady rise rather than stopping.

That gives a flame two ways to end. [`Velocity`](/keys/velocity/) divided by this figure is how many frames it can travel; whichever of that and [`MaxEC`](/keys/maxec/) is shorter is what the flame actually gets, and the stock flame's `28.0` against `0.01` reaches far past its own lifetime. A negative figure adds speed instead: a flame given one never slows to a halt and lives out its full lifetime, accelerating the whole way.
