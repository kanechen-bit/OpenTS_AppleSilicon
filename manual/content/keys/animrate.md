A counter is loaded with the figure when the projectile is created and reloaded every time the shape steps, counting down one per game frame; the shape advances when it reaches zero. `AnimRate=1` therefore shows a new frame every game frame, 15 a second, and `AnimRate=4` shows one every four.

The figure is consulted only while the animation runs, which needs [`AnimLow`](/keys/animlow/) or [`AnimHigh`](/keys/animhigh/) to be other than `0`.

:::caution[`AnimRate=0` does not hold the animation still]
The counter is a single byte, and counting down from zero wraps it to 255 rather than stopping it. The shape steps once every 256 game frames — a little over seventeen seconds — instead. Figures above `255` wrap the same way.

The setting is read from the art section named by the projectile's [`Image`](/keys/image/). That assignment is required. Without it the lookup runs against an empty section name, so nothing here is read — not even from an art section named after the projectile, which is where its [`Voxel`](/keys/voxel/) setting is still found.
