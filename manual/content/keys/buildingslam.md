```ini title="rules.ini"
[AudioVisual]
BuildingSlam=PLACE2 ; a sound registered in [SoundList]
```

The sound is played once a finished structure has been placed and its factory closed out, and only when the placing house is the local player's — another player putting a structure down is silent on this side of the connection. Walls and firestorm wall segments run the same branch, so laying a wall makes the same sound as raising a building.

It is played without a position, so it comes through at full volume wherever the view happens to be sitting.
