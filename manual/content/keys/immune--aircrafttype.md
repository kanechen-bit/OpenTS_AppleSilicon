Damage processing leaves a runtime instance of an immune type at its current strength and reports no result, so the shot lands and nothing happens. Only damage marked forced gets through, which is how paths that must not be resisted — Tiberium poisoning an infantryman, a demolition charge counting down on a structure — still kill an immune object.

A TerrainType is reachable only by a warhead marked [`Wood=yes`](/keys/wood/) to begin with, so an immune one has no damage path left at all and a vehicle treats it as impassable rather than repeatedly trying to clear it.

The [low-power damage tick](/systems/power/#the-structure-damage-tick) is not forced, so `Immune=yes` is one way to keep a structure that draws power from decaying while its house is short.
