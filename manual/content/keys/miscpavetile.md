Thirteen of the fourteen tiles have a use, split in two groups; offset 7 is placed by nothing. Offsets 0 through 6 are the small patches the random map generator scatters over a generated town, and the last three of those are placed only where a two-by-two block of plain pavement is free. Offsets 8 through 13 are the large weathering patches, tiled in two-cell steps across one of five fixed rectangles and refused on any cell that is neither plain pavement nor one of offsets 0 through 7.

Unlike pavement proper these tiles have no blend family of their own. They instead count as pavement when [`ClearToPaveLat`](/keys/cleartopavelat/) examines a neighbor, so dressing a paved square with them does not make the square blend against itself.

The terrain test that asks whether a cell holds one of these tiles is not gated on the role resolving: left unresolved, it accepts everything up to index 12, so the theater's first thirteen tiles answer yes.
