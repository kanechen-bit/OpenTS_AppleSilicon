summary: The servicing delay an armed building on this mission waits between passes.

  note: The mission's own Rate=, taken from the same section.

The value is a fraction of a minute, multiplied out to game frames at 900 to the minute and truncated, with a random zero to two frames added on top. Only two paths ask for it, and both belong to structures.

- An armed building idling on guard, having found nothing to attack, waits this long before looking again.
- A [`SAM=yes`](/keys/sam/) building on the attack mission reaches it only as a fall-through. Both states of its launcher return a single frame, so the delay is served only when the mission was entered as an override, which leaves the state machine standing wherever the previous mission left it instead of restarting it.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[Guard]
Rate=.030
AARate=.016
```

The name, and the note beside it in the shipped rules, describe an anti-aircraft override, but neither path tests whether the building or its target has anything to do with aircraft: this is the ordinary servicing delay for a weapon-equipped structure standing on guard.

An unarmed building does not fall back to the mission's [`Rate`](/keys/rate/#scope-mission-behavior) in its place. [`HasStupidGuardMode`](/keys/hasstupidguardmode/) defaults to `yes`, which ends such a building's guard after a fixed 100 frames without consulting either figure. `Rate` reaches a building on its own account instead: the repair, missile, unload and open missions all read it with no test of armament.

:::caution[The delay can come out at zero frames]
The read falls back to the mission's `Rate=` whenever the result is zero, so `AARate=0` behaves exactly like leaving the key out — including when the section sets `Rate=0`, which the fallback then carries through. A figure below about `.0012` also multiplies out to zero once truncated, leaving nothing but the random frames the caller adds on top.
