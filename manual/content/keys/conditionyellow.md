Crossing the threshold switches a structure to its damaged artwork and to the damaged form of each animation it starts, and it is the point at which a computer house's aircraft break off to look for a repair bay.

The same threshold bounds the [low-power damage tick](/systems/power/#the-structure-damage-tick), which only touches a structure standing strictly above it. A shortfall therefore grinds a base down to this fraction and stops; raising the value shortens that decay and lowering it lets a shortfall take a base closer to destruction.
