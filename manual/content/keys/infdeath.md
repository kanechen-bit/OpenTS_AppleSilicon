The setting is one of six numbers, and the table gives the death each one produces. What separates the rows is whether the soldier plays a sequence where it stands or is simply taken away with an animation left in its place, which is what the two paragraphs after the table turn on.

| Value | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | The soldier is removed at once, with no death sequence and no corpse |
| `1` | The gun death sequence |
| `2` | The explosion death sequence |
| `3` | The [`InfantryExplode`](/keys/infantryexplode/) animation is left where the soldier stood, and the soldier is removed |
| `4` | A [`Doggie=yes`](/keys/doggie/) type plays its own burning death; any other type is removed and leaves the [`FlamingInfantry`](/keys/flaminginfantry/) animation behind |
| `5` | A `Doggie=yes` type plays its own burning death; any other type is removed and leaves the electrocution animation behind |

Any value outside that range behaves as `0`.

InfDeath=4
```

A sequence played on the soldier itself — `1`, `2`, and the dog branch of `4` and `5` — holds the body in place until the animation runs out. The soldier is removed at that point, and every type but a dog drops one of the [`DeadBodies`](/keys/deadbodies/) corpses as it goes.

Three deaths never reach the setting at all. A prone cyborg and a jump-jet infantryman both leave the `InfantryExplode` animation, and a soldier that dies over water after being knocked off a height leaves a wake and a splash. A soldier killed by a [laser fence](/systems/laser-fences/) is forced onto `5` whatever its attacker's warhead says. A cyborg killed by forced damage is removed at once whatever the setting names: the sequence for `1` or `2` still starts, but the body is taken away on the same step.

:::caution[The electrocution animation is fixed to a slot]
`InfDeath=5` does not name its animation. It takes whichever animation stands second in the animation list, so inserting, removing or reordering entries ahead of that position changes what an electrocuted soldier leaves behind.
:::

:::caution[A burning soldier is drawn in the observer's own colors]
The `FlamingInfantry` animation of `InfDeath=4` is recolored with the local player's color scheme rather than with the dead soldier's house colors, so the same death looks different on each machine in the game.
