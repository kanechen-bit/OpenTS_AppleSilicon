The sound plays at the debris' position on every frame the bounce physics report a strike, under exactly the conditions [`BounceAnim`](/keys/bounceanim/#scope-voxelanimtype) describes: not in a water cell, and not on the contact that settles the piece.

A value naming no registered sound leaves whatever was set before in place rather than clearing it, so a misspelled name is silently ignored.
