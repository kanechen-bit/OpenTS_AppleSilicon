The horizontal half of the pre-production slot's offset. It carries the [`PreProductionAnim`](/keys/preproductionanim/) animation right across the screen from the point the structure is drawn at, and a negative figure moves it left of that point instead. The offset pins the animation to a point on the artwork rather than to a cell, so it holds wherever the structure stands.

[Placement and draw order](/systems/building-animations/#placement-and-draw-order) covers how the offset differs from the two draw-order biases, and [Where the settings are read](/keys/productionanim/#where-the-settings-are-read) covers which art entry the two figures come from.
