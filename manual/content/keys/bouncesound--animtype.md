The sound plays at the thrown animation's position on the frame the bounce physics report a strike, under exactly the conditions [`BounceAnim`](/keys/bounceanim/#scope-animtype) describes: on the one contact that ends the flight, not on a contact that settles the animation instead, and without regard to whether the ground under it is water.

A value naming no registered sound leaves whatever was set before in place rather than clearing it, so a misspelled name is silently ignored.
