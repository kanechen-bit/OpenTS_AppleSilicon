What the speed moves depends on the [behavior](/keys/behaveslike/#scope-particletype). A `Fire` particle covers this many leptons along its line of fire each frame, anything from about a quarter slower to a twelfth faster, and a flame given no speed at all is flagged for death on its first logic frame before it has traveled anywhere. A `Smoke` particle climbs by this many leptons a frame, with a random one lepton added or taken away as it is created so a plume does not rise as a solid column. A `Railgun` particle steps this far along the beam each frame, after the holding system has added its own perturbation to each particle it lays down. `Gas`, `WeakGas`, `Spark` and `Web` particles hold a speed but never move by it — a spark's motion comes from [`XVelocity`](/keys/xvelocity/), [`YVelocity`](/keys/yvelocity/) and [`ZVelocityRange`](/keys/zvelocityrange/) instead, and a web particle does not move at all.

A cell is 256 leptons across, so the stock flame's `28.0` crosses a cell in nine frames while a railgun particle's `0.4` barely creeps. [`Deacc`](/keys/deacc/) takes the speed back down from here, and a successor created through [`NextParticle`](/keys/nextparticle/) inherits the speed its predecessor had reached rather than starting again at this figure.
