key: SpecialThreatValue
summary: A per-type figure that TargetSpecialThreatCoefficient scales into a candidate's threat score.

The figure is read from the candidate's type and multiplied by the [`TargetSpecialThreatCoefficient`](/keys/targetspecialthreatcoefficient/) of the object doing the choosing, making it the one term of the threat score authored on the target rather than on the shooter. Raising it makes every object with a positive coefficient prefer that type, and every object with a negative coefficient avoid it.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MYPRIZE] ; example UnitType worth hunting
SpecialThreatValue=50
```

Unlike the five coefficients, this value has no global fallback in `[General]`: a type that omits the key keeps `0` and contributes nothing to the term, whatever the coefficient is set to.
