Only a BuildingType's value is ever consulted. The computer's own [repair-or-sell decision](/systems/repair/#when-the-computer-repairs) runs through the same candidate test, so `Repairable=no` also exempts a building from automatic repair and sell-back. The cursor consumers:

- The wrench accepts the building only while this is set and the building is below full [`Strength`](/keys/strength/#scope-aircrafttype), or while it carries a limpet mine.
- An engineer offers no restore cursor on an allied structure without it, unless the type is a mobile war factory. The capture cursor on an enemy structure is a separate path that never consults this key — that one follows [`Capturable=yes`](/keys/capturable/).
- A commando plants explosives on a building with it and shoots at one without it.

A service depot never reads the value, so `Repairable=no` on a vehicle or aircraft does not stop a depot from repairing it. The wrench, meanwhile, refuses every non-building whatever the value says.
