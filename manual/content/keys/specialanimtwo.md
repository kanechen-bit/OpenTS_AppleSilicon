[Building animations](/systems/building-animations/) covers the slot mechanism all three share, and [what starts a special animation](/keys/specialanim/#what-starts-a-special-animation) covers which structures reach a special slot at all. The second slot is the middle stage of a [`UnitRepair=yes`](/keys/unitrepair/) depot's sequence: it is created when the first slot's animation plays to its end and stopped as the visit ends, so a first animation that loops keeps this one from ever appearing.

A [`FirestormWall=yes`](/keys/firestormwall/) section takes the slot for a hard-coded animation of its own and leaves this name unused. The fill indicator of a [`SiloDamage=yes`](/keys/silodamage/) structure never reaches it.
