The exemption is read twice. A [vein cell](/systems/veins/#standing-in-veins) skips an exempt object when it decides whether to start its attack, so an exempt object standing alone on mature veins never sets one off; and the attack, once running for something else in the same cell, passes over the exempt object when it deals out its damage. The `VEIN_PROOF` veteran ability grants a single object the same exemption without the type carrying this flag.
