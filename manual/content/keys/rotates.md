The frame drawn is picked from the projectile's current heading, rounded to one of 32 directions. Without the setting every projectile of the type is drawn from the first frame of its artwork however it is pointing.

A flight animation overrides it completely. While either [`AnimLow`](/keys/animlow/) or [`AnimHigh`](/keys/animhigh/) is other than `0` the animation frame is drawn and the heading is not consulted, so the two cannot be combined. A [`Voxel=yes`](/keys/voxel/) projectile is turned in three dimensions rather than picked out of a frame set, and reads neither.

The setting is read from the art section named by the projectile's [`Image`](/keys/image/). That assignment is required. Without it the lookup runs against an empty section name, so nothing here is read — not even from an art section named after the projectile, which is where its `Voxel` setting is still found.
