The delta is added alongside the trigger's own [history term](/systems/ai-team-production/#the-track-record), and the result is then held inside the minimum and maximum weight the trigger carries. Because that clamp is applied every time, a value larger than the span between a trigger's own bounds only makes it reach its maximum sooner; it cannot push the weight past it.
