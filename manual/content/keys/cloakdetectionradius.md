Every frame a jumpjet is moving it sweeps a square this many cells out from the position it has just moved to — `2` covers a five-by-five block of cells — and uncloaks everything standing in it. The engine default of `0` reduces the sweep to the jumpjet's own cell, so the setting must be raised before a jumpjet reveals anything beyond the cell it is directly over.

:::caution[The sweep ignores ownership entirely]
Nothing in it tests the house. A jumpjet flying over its own base uncloaks its owner's hidden vehicles and structures, and its allies', exactly as it uncloaks an enemy's. [Losing a cloak](/systems/cloaking/#losing-a-cloak) lists what that costs the objects caught underneath.
