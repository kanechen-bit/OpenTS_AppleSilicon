key: WaterAmount
summary: How much of a generated map is put under water, as a figure from 0 to 100.

  note: The read passes the current setting through, and the generator's settings outlive one map, so an omitted assignment keeps whatever the last map built in this session left behind.

The figure is a budget rather than a share. It is multiplied by the playable area and by a factor chosen per biome, and a hundred cells are added on top; the river and lake passes spend against that total and stop when it runs out. The per-biome factor is what makes the same figure wetter on tundra than on temperate and far drier on desert, which is given a third of what the next driest biome gets and a quarter of what tundra gets. [Map seed files](/formats/map-seed/) covers the section it is written in.

```ini title="map seed file"
[RandomMap]
Biome=2
WaterAmount=45
```

At `0` the whole water pass is skipped and the map is left dry. Above `0` a lake is attempted, up to ten times before the generator gives up and settles for a drier map than was asked for. A river is attempted first, on the same ten-try basis, but only above `20` and never on the desert biome. The figure also widens the river's brush and lengthens an arctic river as it rises.
