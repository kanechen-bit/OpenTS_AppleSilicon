Only the body is remapped. The shadow thrown under a projectile that is above the ground is drawn from the normal palette either way, so a remapped projectile keeps an ordinary shadow. A [`Voxel=yes`](/keys/voxel/) projectile is drawn through the voxel path, which takes its colors from [`Color`](/keys/color/#scope-bullettype) and never consults this setting.

The setting is read from the art section named by the projectile's [`Image`](/keys/image/). That assignment is required. Without it the lookup runs against an empty section name, so nothing here is read — not even from an art section named after the projectile, which is where its `Voxel` setting is still found.
