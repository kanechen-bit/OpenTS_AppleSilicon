A [`Webby=yes`](/keys/webby/) warhead striking an infantryman who is not [`IsWebImmune=yes`](/keys/iswebimmune/) deals no damage at all and instead pins him for [`WebDuration`](/keys/webduration/) frames, spread by [`WebDurationVariation`](/keys/webdurationvariation/), putting him into the struggling sequence and springing any paralyzed trigger on his tag. For as long as he is in that sequence, this animation's artwork is used in his place.

Only the artwork is substituted. The frame shown is still chosen from the soldier's own struggling sequence, and his facing, remap, position and everything else about him are unchanged, so the substitute has to be built to match the sequence it stands in for.

The substitution is guarded, so leaving the key unset draws the soldier in his own artwork while he struggles rather than failing. It also takes precedence over the [`Disguise`](/keys/disguise/) substitution, so a webbed spy shows the web rather than his cover.
