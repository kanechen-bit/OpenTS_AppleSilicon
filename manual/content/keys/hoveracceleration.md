The figure is a length of time, not a rate, so raising it makes a hover unit slower off the mark. Each frame the drive raises the throttle by `1 ÷ (HoverAcceleration × 900)` of full and stops at the ceiling the drive is holding, which [`HoverBoost`](/keys/hoverboost/) scales, which at 900 frames to the minute makes the value the length of a standing start: the stock `.02` is 18 frames, a little over a second.

Only the climb is measured here. Closing the throttle again runs on [`HoverBrake`](/keys/hoverbrake/).
