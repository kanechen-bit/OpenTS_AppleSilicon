The multiplier sits at the end of the step price, after the object's cost has been divided into steps: `(cost / (Strength / RepairStep)) * RepairPercent`, never less than one credit. It applies to every path that charges for a repair — the wrench on a structure and a service depot working on a vehicle or aircraft — and infantry never reach it, because a hospital is free.

The share is approximate in both directions. Both divisions and the multiplication truncate, so a structure costing 1000 with [`Strength=400`](/keys/strength/) is charged 3 credits for each of its 80 steps at the default — 240 credits rather than the 250 the fraction names. The one-credit floor pushes the other way on anything cheap with a large strength: a structure costing 100 with `Strength=1000` is charged the floor on all 200 of its steps, and a full repair costs twice what the structure did. [The cost of one step](/systems/repair/#the-cost-of-one-step) shows where each truncation lands.
