One pass reads the role, and only in the snow theater. It considers a cell eligible when the cell is empty, is clear ground, or already holds one of these forty-eight tiles, then builds a pattern from all eight neighbors according to which of them fall inside the ice run described by [`Ice3Set`](/keys/ice3set/). That pattern selects the piece.

The lookup it uses is shared with the ice-side edge pieces of [`Ice1Set`](/keys/ice1set/) and its two companions, and it yields three kinds of result. A value from 1 to 46 is a piece, taken at that offset into this set — so offsets 0, 15 and 47 are never produced. A second result means no shore piece suits the pattern and the cell should become plain ice instead, which turns the cell over to the ice pass and re-runs the shore decision around it. The third means nothing suits and the cell is left as it is.

:::caution[The pass is not gated on the role resolving]
Only the snow theater is checked. With the role unresolved the eligibility window opens onto the theater's first forty-seven tiles, and the piece written to a cell is one below its number — so unrelated ground tiles are picked up as ice shore and overwritten with other unrelated tiles.
