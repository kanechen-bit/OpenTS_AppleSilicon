  note: "`TEM` for TEMPERATE and `SNO` for SNOW, which keep their original settings; empty for any other theater, which then looks for artwork under no extension at all and has no unit remap palette."

The suffix is the file extension every piece of theater-specific artwork carries, and the stem of several files besides. A type marked [`Theater=yes`](/keys/theater/) loads `<name>.<Suffix>`, and so does each tile of a [tile set](/formats/theater-control/).

The same value names five more files:

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `<Suffix>.MIX` | The theater's second archive |
| `ISO<Suffix>.PAL` | The palette the tiles are drawn through |
| `UNIT<Suffix>.PAL` | The palette unit and structure colour schemes are built from |
| `SLOP01Z.<Suffix>` through `SLOP04Z.<Suffix>` | The depth shapes for sloped ground |
| `VEINHOLE.<Suffix>` | The veinhole monster's artwork |

```ini title="rules.ini"
[DESERT]
Suffix=DES      ; GACNST.DES, DES.MIX, ISODES.PAL, UNITDES.PAL
```

The three characters the original game used are not a limit; a longer suffix works everywhere the value is used.
