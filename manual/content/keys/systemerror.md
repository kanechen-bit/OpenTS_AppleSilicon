```ini title="rules.ini"

SystemError=BUZZER1 ; a sound ID registered in SOUND.INI
```

The sound belongs to the LAN game list and is played without a position, always beside a system line printed into the chat panel explaining the refusal. Seven refusals are checked before a join request is even sent: no game selected, no game left in the list to join, an empty player handle, a game that is no longer open, a Firestorm game with the expansion not installed, a Firestorm game with the expansion installed but not enabled, and a base-game host approached from a Firestorm client. An eighth plays it when a request that was sent comes back rejected by the host — because the name is already taken, because the game is full, or for any other reason the host gives.

Nothing outside that list uses it, so it is not a general-purpose error sound: an interface refusal during a match takes [`ScoldSound`](/keys/scoldsound/) instead.
