The flag is read while [the base plan is assembled](/systems/ai-base-building/#building-the-plan), beside the type's [`Owner`](/keys/owner/) entry and the scenario tech level, and nowhere else. A house whose node list came with the scenario never consults it, and `AIBuildThis=no` restricts nothing a player, a trigger or a team builds.
