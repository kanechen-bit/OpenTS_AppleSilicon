The value names a section listed in `[SuperWeaponTypes]`, not a behavior, so two structures may grant two sections that deliver the same effect. A house is [granted the weapon](/systems/superweapons/#from-a-structure-or-a-plug) while it owns at least one active, unlimboed structure of this type, and loses it again when the last one goes; switching the structure off suspends the weapon rather than removing it. A name the engine cannot resolve to a declared section leaves the type granting nothing.

The key is read on the type, so it works both on a structure a house builds and on a plug installed into one — but a plug's grant skips the [`AuxBuilding=`](/keys/auxbuilding/) test the structure's own grant goes through.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[GAPLUG3]       ; Ion Cannon Uplink, a plug for the GDI Upgrade Center
PowersUpBuilding=GAPLUG
SuperWeapon=IonCannonSpecial
```

The same value is what a [`NukeSilo=yes`](/keys/nukesilo/) type is matched against when a missile weapon looks for somewhere to launch from.
