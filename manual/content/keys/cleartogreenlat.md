Green terrain blends by the rule [`ClearToRoughLat`](/keys/cleartoroughlat/) describes, against the single plain [`GreenTile`](/keys/greentile/) ground tile. When the set is unresolved the whole green family is skipped, and green terrain keeps its square edges.

A cell holding one of these sixteen tiles is treated as clear ground when the random map generator scatters loose rock, so it takes a clear rock overlay rather than the sand rock overlays a [`ClearToSandLat`](/keys/cleartosandlat/) cell would take.
