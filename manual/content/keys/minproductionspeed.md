A house short of power builds at a multiplier taken from its power fraction, and build time is divided by that multiplier — `0.5` doubles it. This value is the floor that multiplier is raised to, so it fixes the worst production speed a shortfall can cause. Raising it to `1` removes the production penalty entirely.

At the default the floor coincides with the lowest step the ladder itself produces, so it changes nothing until it is moved. [The production ladder](/systems/power/#production) lists the steps it is applied to.
