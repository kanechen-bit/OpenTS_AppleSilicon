[VeinholeWH] ; the WarheadType vein damage is applied with
Veinhole=yes
```

The warhead decides what [`VeinDamage`](/keys/veindamage/) actually costs each armor class, and [`Veinhole=yes`](/keys/veinhole/) on it is what lets a hurt object shoot back at the monster that grew the veins.

:::caution[Veins with no warhead are harmless]
This setting has no built-in value. Damage carrying no warhead is reduced to zero and dropped before any object's strength changes, so a field with the setting unresolved plays its attack over every cell it covers and takes nothing off anything standing there.
