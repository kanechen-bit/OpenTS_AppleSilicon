The flag puts the vehicle on the same creature conduct that [`SmallVisceroid=yes`](/keys/smallvisceroid/#scope-unittype) describes — the aimless wandering, the run for Tiberium below [`ConditionYellow`](/keys/conditionyellow/) health, the attack frames from [`AltImage`](/keys/altimage/), and the exemptions from EM pulses, immobilization, turret facing, jellyfish stings and shadows — and it forces [`NonVehicle`](/keys/nonvehicle/) on in the same way.

What it does not carry is merging. A large visceroid neither summons a neighbor nor is summoned by one, and two of them standing beside each other block one another's cells like any other pair of vehicles. Marking a type this way is therefore the whole of the difference: whether it grows by absorbing its own kind, or is what that absorption produces.

A type is not obliged to be reachable through merging to carry the flag. The UnitType a merge actually produces is the one named by [`LargeVisceroid`](/keys/largevisceroid/#scope-global-rules) in the global rules, which is a separate choice from this one; a type carrying this flag that nothing names there simply behaves as a large visceroid wherever it is placed.
