The value is substituted whenever a type's own [`MyEffectivenessCoefficient`](/keys/myeffectivenesscoefficient/) is zero and the section being read omits the key. An explicit `0` in a section survives its own pass; it is replaced only when a later rules layer carries the section without the key. `[General]` is read before the object types in each pass over the rules, so a value written here reaches every type in the same file.

Raising it switches this term of the threat score on for the whole rules file at once, and makes it impossible to hold any single type at zero.
