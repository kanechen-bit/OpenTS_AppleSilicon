Nothing distinguishes a power-hungry defense from any other. Every candidate for a defense node is drawn the same way, from the values [the defense planner](/systems/ai-base-building/#base-defenses) reads off the types a house may own, and a planned structure's drain is weighed only when the planner decides whether to [insert a power plant ahead of it](/systems/ai-base-building/#power-and-money-interventions).
