A storm does not apply this level outright: it becomes the target of [the ambient fade](/systems/ion-storms/#the-ambient-ramp), which walks the map down to it over several steps and back up to [`Ambient`](/keys/ambient/) when the storm ends. The palette tint changes at once, so a map with a dark ion level shows its ion colors well before it shows its ion darkness.
