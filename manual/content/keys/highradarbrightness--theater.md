This is the scale a cell's radar colours reach at the top of the height range. A cell is interpolated between [`LowRadarBrightness`](/keys/lowradarbrightness/) and this one by its own height, so the gap between the two is how strongly high ground stands out from low.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[DESERT]
HighRadarBrightness=1.6
```

Setting it equal to `LowRadarBrightness` flattens the radar, and setting it below makes high ground read darker than low.
