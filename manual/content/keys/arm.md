The fuse trips when the projectile comes within 64 leptons of the point it was aimed at, height included, and again when it is within two cells of that point and has started to move away from it. While the arming count is still running the fuse reports nothing at all, so the projectile flies on. The count is in game frames — 15 to the second, 900 to the game minute — and it starts when the projectile is launched.

Only a projectile steered by the homing flight model consults its fuse at all. A projectile whose [`ROT`](/keys/rot/#scope-bullettype) is zero never checks it, so the setting changes nothing on an unguided shot.

A shot at an aircraft is armed with zero whatever the section says.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MYSEEKER] ; a BulletType, registered by a weapon naming it as its Projectile
Image=MISSILE
ROT=5
Arm=30 ; the fuse cannot trip for the first two seconds of flight
```

:::caution[Arming does not hold off the other detonation paths]
Only the fuse is held shut. A projectile still detonates while arming under **Any of:**

- it reaches its target;
- it drops to ground level;
- it runs into a wall or another tall overlay;
- it crosses a bridge deck;
- it has spent the flight distance a [`Ranged=yes`](/keys/ranged/) projectile is given;
- **All of:** it is marked [`AA=yes`](/keys/aa/), and it comes within half a cell of the aircraft or airborne jumpjet it is chasing;
- it stops gaining on its target.

A very large figure therefore does not make a projectile fly forever; it only stops the proximity trip from ever being the reason it goes off.
