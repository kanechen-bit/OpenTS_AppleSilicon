The flag is consulted in exactly two places, both inside the routine that draws a terrain tile and both behind a parameter saying the tile is being drawn as fog. Neither of the two calls into that routine passes it, so the checkerboard alternative the flag selects is never reached and `BlendedFog=no` draws nothing differently.

Fog is drawn from its own artwork over the alpha buffer instead, which is why the flag makes no visible difference either way.
