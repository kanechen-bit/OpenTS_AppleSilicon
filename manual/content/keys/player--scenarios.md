The value names a HouseType and settles which house the player commands for the rest of a campaign mission. Everything created afterwards is measured against that house — ownership, allegiance, buildable lists, the money the mission starts with — and the campaign's map selection screen reads its progression list from the same house. A multiplayer or skirmish game assigns houses from the lobby and never reaches this read.

The lookup accepts either the house's ID or its full name and ignores case.

:::danger[A house the scenario does not contain leaves the player pointer null]
The houses a mission contains are the first HouseTypes the rules registered, as many of them as the map's `[Houses]` list has entries. When the named house is not among them, the search for it returns nothing and the very next statement writes through the empty result. A name that matches no registered house at all is worse still: rather than being rejected it registers a fresh HouseType, which no scenario can ever contain, so a typo here is enough to end the load in a null write.
