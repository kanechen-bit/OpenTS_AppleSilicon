Clicking a cameo the weapon cannot be fired from picks between this line and [`SuspendVoice=`](/keys/suspendvoice/) on whether the charge timer is running: a running timer gives this one. A [`ManualControl=yes`](/keys/manualcontrol/) weapon sits with its timer stopped between firings and so answers with the suspend line instead, whatever is set here. An unrecognized speech name is not rejected; it leaves the weapon with no line.
