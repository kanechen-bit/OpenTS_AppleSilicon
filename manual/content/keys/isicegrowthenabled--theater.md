Ice is a snow feature the rest of the simulation is gated on. Where this is off, no ice sheet grows or is smoothed, a vehicle crossing ice never cracks it, and [`IceGrowthEnabled`](/keys/icegrowthenabled/) on a map does nothing.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[DESERT]
IsIceGrowthEnabled=no
```

It also decides one thing at load time: a theater with ice has the land type of its ice edge tiles rewritten to water, so that units treat the open edge of a sheet as the sea it floats in. A theater without ice keeps whatever land types its tiles declare.
