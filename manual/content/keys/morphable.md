The value is read once per tile set and applied to every tile the set produces. Three things consult it, through four tests in all:

- Raising or lowering the ground refuses to move a cell whose tile forbids it. Two predicates ask the question — the one the smoothing pass uses and the map generator's own — and what else each refuses differs, but neither moves a cell the flag pins. Objects standing on a cell can veto a height change as well, and the tile pins it whatever is or is not standing there.
- A crater or scorch mark is refused on such a cell. [`Height`](/keys/height/#scope-smudgetype) explains the rest of the placement test and how a smudge covering several cells is checked.
- A structure that paves the ground it is placed on — one that turns its cells into a tile of its own — may not be built where the tile forbids reshaping.

A cell whose tile index is unresolved is treated differently by each. Reshaping and building both let it through as though the flag were set; the smudge test instead answers with the flag on the theater's very first tile.

```ini title="TEMPERAT.INI"
[TileSet0631]      ; example cliff set
SetName=Riverbank cliffs
FileName=RVCLIF
TilesInSet=8
Morphable=no       ; cliffs stay where the artwork puts them
```

Nothing else consults the flag: it does not affect movement, buildability in general, Tiberium growth, or which tiles the blend families may replace.
