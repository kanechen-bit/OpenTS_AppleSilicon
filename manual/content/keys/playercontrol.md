A campaign scenario decides what counts as the local player's house by asking each house two questions: whether it is flagged as human, and whether it carries this setting. Either one is enough. Outside a campaign the question is answered by identity instead — only the house the local machine is actually playing counts, and this setting is ignored there.

```ini title="scenario map file"
[GDI] ; a house record in the scenario's own house list
PlayerControl=yes
Edge=North
```

What that answer governs is everything the engine does *for* a player rather than *to* a house: the difficulty slot the house is given, the EVA lines it hears, the radar events drawn for it, and the sidebar and placement feedback it is given. [Difficulty settings and handicaps](/systems/difficulty/#from-the-setting-to-a-slot) covers that first half, which is where a missing flag is felt hardest.

The setting is cleared, permanently, when a house passes to the computer.

:::caution[Setting it on more than one house is allowed]
Nothing restricts the flag to a single house, and each house carrying it is treated as player-controlled in its own right — including when difficulty slots are assigned, so every one of them is given the player's slot rather than the computer's.
