The setting is read only on the branch of the Guard mission taken by a building with no first-slot weapon. An armed building scans for targets on the other branch and never reaches it, so the setting cannot change what a defensive structure does.

Left at `yes`, Guard returns after 100 frames having done nothing. Set to `no`, the building runs its idle handling instead: a repair bay or reload bay whose customer is waiting at the door, within a quarter of a cell and free to move, switches to the repair mission, and a weapons factory clears the bib its exit occupies.
