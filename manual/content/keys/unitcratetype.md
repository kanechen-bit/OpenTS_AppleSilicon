With a type named here, the unit result always creates that type. With `UnitCrateType=none` the result falls back to the two rescues described below and, when neither applies, draws repeatedly from the registered UnitTypes until it finds one that is [`CrateGoodie=yes`](/keys/crategoodie/) and ownable by the collector's house.

:::caution[Naming a type cancels both free-vehicle rescues]
The unit result first checks whether the collector's house has lost its base and can afford to rebuild, and then whether it owns a refinery but no unit of the first [`HarvesterUnit`](/keys/harvesterunit/) type, choosing the MCV or a harvester accordingly. This setting is applied after both and overwrites either one, so naming a type here means a house that has lost its base receives that type instead of an MCV.
