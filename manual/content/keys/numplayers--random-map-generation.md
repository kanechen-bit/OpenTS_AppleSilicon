The figure is the number of start points the generator must find, and it also chooses the row of the size tables that [`Height`](/keys/height/#scope-random-map-generation) interpolates within, so it decides how large a map of a given size index comes out. [Map seed files](/formats/map-seed/) covers the section it is written in.

```ini title="map seed file"
[RandomMap]
NumPlayers=4
Width=2
Height=2
```

Finding the start points comes late in generation, after the terrain and its regions are settled. Fifteen candidate cells per player are gathered from the largest regions reachable from one another, the most widely separated of them are taken, and the first of those become the start points. Each start point then has to flood exactly four hundred clear cells around itself; if any player's flood runs dry sooner the start points are all discarded and picked again from the next state of the random sequence — the terrain itself is kept. Nothing caps that retry, so a player count the terrain cannot seat leaves the generator picking forever.

The figure reaches the tiberium as well. The spread that supplied the start points supplies the map's tiberium fields from what is left over, and the amount of tiberium each field is grown to is multiplied by the player count, so a map built for more players is not left thinner. [`TiberiumLayout`](/keys/tiberiumlayout/) covers how many fields there are, which the player count does not change.

:::danger[A figure outside two through eight reads past the size tables]
The figure is held to `2` through `8` whenever the map generator dialog is read or filled in and whenever the settings are randomized. A seed file read as the game starts goes through none of those. The row of the size tables is chosen as the figure minus two, with no bounds check, so `1` or `0` reads before the front of all four tables and `9` or more reads past the back. The playable area is then sized from whatever those reads return, and the map is laid out at that size before a single cell is placed.
