The shadow is drawn first, in [`TargetLaserDropShadowColor`](/keys/targetlaserdropshadowcolor/), one row below the line, or two rows below a [thick](/keys/targetlaserthick/) one, and the squares on the line's ends gain a border of the same colour. The sighting laser is the line a firing vehicle with [`TargetLaser=yes`](/keys/targetlaser/) draws to where its shot is aimed; [Action lines](/systems/action-lines/) covers when it is drawn.
