key: FireSupress
summary: How far around a candidate target allied buildings are searched for when the firing weapon suppresses friendly fire.

  kind: value
  value: "1"
  note: One cell leaves no ring for the search to walk, so the penalty never applies until the value is raised.

The search runs only for an object whose first weapon slot sets [`Supress=yes`](/keys/supress/), and only while that object is scoring candidates. It walks the square cell rings around the candidate from radius `1` out to one cell short of this distance, and halves the candidate's threat score once for every ring cell holding an allied building — four such cells leave a sixteenth of the original score, and a building spanning several ring cells counts once per cell.

The value is a distance in cells and fractions are accepted, but the search truncates it to whole cells: `2` walks one ring, `3` walks two, and anything below `2` walks none.
