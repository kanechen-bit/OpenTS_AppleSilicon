A superweapon is suspended when the building granting it is switched off or its house cannot meet its drain, and this value is what the suspend step checks: `IsPowered=no` leaves the weapon charging through both. Resuming does not consult the value, so a weapon suspended for another reason still comes back. One path bypasses the check: a weapon granted while the house is already short of power arrives suspended whatever this value says, and resumes once the building is on and the power restored.

:::caution[Suspension costs a charge-draining weapon its progress]
An ordinary superweapon's timer is stopped where it stands and restarts from there. A weapon declared [`UseChargeDrain=yes`](/keys/usechargedrain/) instead has its timer reset to a full [`RechargeTime`](/keys/rechargetime/) when it resumes, so every spell of low power starts its charge over. `IsPowered=no` is the only way to keep such a weapon charging through one.
