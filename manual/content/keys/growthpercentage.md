The queued cell count multiplied by this fraction, clamped to between 5 and 50, gives the pass its ceiling; the pass then draws a random figure from 1 up to that ceiling and takes that many cells. The clamp means a pass always handles at least one cell and never more than 50, however large or small the field is.

At `0.00001` or below the pass exits before touching the queue, and below that figure no individual cell of the type passes its growth test either.
