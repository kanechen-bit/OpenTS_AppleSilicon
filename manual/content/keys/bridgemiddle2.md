This position carries the north-south span the same five conditions in the same order that [`BridgeMiddle1`](/keys/bridgemiddle1/) carries the east-west one, and that page covers how a position is measured and how the ladder is stepped.

Which of the two is consulted follows from the direction a span is walked in, not from the tile alone. A walk that runs east steps middles from `BridgeMiddle1`; a walk that runs south steps them from here.
