A north-south span is found by this end. Whether an engineer is mending a bridge or a span is being brought down, the search accepts a cell at this position showing subtile `12` and then works south from it toward the far end. [`BridgeMiddle1`](/keys/bridgemiddle1/) covers how a position is measured.

An end piece has no condition ladder of its own. It is marked whole or damaged instead, and the mark is carried to every neighboring cell drawn from the same piece.
