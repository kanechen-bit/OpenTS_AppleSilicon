This is a second, separate read of the assignment, made from the multiplayer lobby rather than by the generator. Before a game is allowed to start, the host's chosen scenario file is opened and its `[Waypoints]` section counted for entries `0` through `7`; only when that count comes to nothing is this assignment read instead, with a fallback of zero. The figure that comes out is compared against the players in the lobby plus the computer players asked for, and a game whose total exceeds it is refused with a message that the scenario is too small.

The fallback is what makes a saved map seed usable in a lobby. A seed file holds no waypoints — the start points do not exist until the map is generated — so without it every seed file would count as having nowhere to put anyone.
