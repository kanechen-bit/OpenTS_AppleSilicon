The sound is played by a crusher as it flattens its victim, and only after that victim has passed a [`Crushable`](/keys/crushable/#scope-animtype) test that an animation can never reach — an animation is never entered into a cell's occupier list, which is where every crush path looks for something to run over. No gameplay path reads the sound.

An animation's own sound is [`Report`](/keys/report/#scope-animtype), read from the same `art.ini` section.
