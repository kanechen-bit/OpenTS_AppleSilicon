key: RandomRate
summary: The pair of playback rates a new animation picks its frame delay from.

  kind: unchanged
  note: Each half is read separately and -1 is treated as absent, leaving that bound as it stands.

Both numbers are animation frames per minute of game time, and each is stored as `900` divided by it in whole numbers — the same conversion [`Rate=`](/keys/rate/#scope-animtype) uses. A wait is picked from the whole numbers between the two stored bounds when an animation of the type is created, and picked again when an animation chains into the type. While both bounds are zero the flat rate is used instead.

A rate of `0` or below stores no wait for that bound, and `-1` in either half leaves that bound at whatever it already held rather than storing anything.

:::caution[The faster rate has to be written first]
The two numbers are stored as waits, so the higher rate becomes the lower bound. If the first number produces a longer wait than the second, the lower bound is raised to meet the upper one, and every animation of the type is given that single wait with no randomness at all. `RandomRate=600,220` picks a wait of between one and four frames; `RandomRate=220,600` describes the same span the other way round and gives a wait of exactly one frame every time.
:::

A value carrying only one number leaves the second bound undefined rather than defaulting it: whatever happened to be in memory is read as the second rate. Both halves have to be written.

[`Normalized=yes`](/keys/normalized/#scope-animtype) rescales whichever wait comes out of the pick.
