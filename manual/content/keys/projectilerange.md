Only a projectile marked [`Ranged=yes`](/keys/ranged/) burns fuel. Such a shot starts with this figure and subtracts the distance it covers each time it moves; the moment it reaches nothing it detonates where it stands, which is what stops a missile chasing an evading target across the map. Every other projectile carries the figure and never spends it.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MyMissile] ; example WeaponType
Range=12
ProjectileRange=14 ; the missile outlasts the shot it was fired for by two cells
Projectile=MyRocket ; a BulletType, registered by a weapon naming it as its Projectile

[MyRocket] ; example BulletType
Ranged=yes
ROT=20
```

The value is written in cells and a fraction is accepted; it is held as 256 units to the cell. The stored default of 100000 units is a little over 390 cells, far past the width of any map, so a fueled projectile with the key unwritten behaves as though it had no fuel limit at all.

A figure of exactly `-1` is read as though the key were absent, leaving whatever an earlier rules file set.

Not every shot draws its fuel from here. A bomblet thrown by an [`AirburstWeapon=`](/keys/airburstweapon/) takes that weapon's [`Range=`](/keys/range/) as its fuel instead, and the two trigger actions that launch a cluster missile and a chemical missile take the figure from the weapons named `MultiLauncher` and `ChemLauncher` wherever those are configured.
