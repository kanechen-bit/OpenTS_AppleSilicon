The name promises a switch for whether a system emits particles under its own power. What a system emits, and on what schedule, is settled by [`BehavesLike`](/keys/behaveslike/#scope-particlesystemtype) alone: a smoke or fire system emits with the flag either way, and a gas or web system lays nothing of its own with the flag either way.

No gameplay path reads the stored flag.
