A [radar event](/reference/enums/radar-event/) pulses between two colors fixed by its kind, and this is how far along that blend it moves each frame. The direction reverses at either end, so the ping runs back and forth rather than jumping. At the default a sweep from one color to the other takes twenty frames and a there-and-back cycle forty, a little under three seconds.

The same value scales the gradient stroked along each edge of the box, so a faster pulse also lays more color bands around the outline. At zero the event holds the color it opened with and never pulses; a negative value reverses on its first frame and runs positive from then on.
