key: RechargeTime
summary: The minutes a superweapon takes to charge, and for a charge-draining weapon the base the drain is scaled from.

The figure is in minutes and is converted to game frames at 900 frames to the minute. Fractions are accepted: the stock chem missile uses `.3`. A [`UseChargeDrain=yes`](/keys/usechargedrain/) weapon measures its discharged spell from the same figure, scaled by [`ChargeToDrainRatio`](/keys/chargetodrainratio/), so raising the delay lengthens both the charge and the effect.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MyIonStrike] ; example superweapon section
Type=IonCannon
RechargeTime=8.5
```

:::caution[`RechargeTime=0` is read as if the key were absent]
This is the one setting in a superweapon's section that does not pass its current value through. The read treats exactly `0` as nothing written, and both leave the delay standing at whatever the last file to set it left there — five minutes if no file ever has. An instantly recharging superweapon cannot be authored here, and a rules layer cannot use `0` to undo a delay an earlier layer set.
