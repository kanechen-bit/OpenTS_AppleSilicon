The shadow is drawn first, in [`NavComQueueLineDropShadowColor`](/keys/navcomqueuelinedropshadowcolor/), one row below each line, or two rows below a [thick](/keys/navcomqueuelinethick/) one, and the squares on the lines' ends gain a border of the same colour. The lines run through a selected object's queued destinations beyond its movement line; [Action lines](/systems/action-lines/) covers when they are drawn.
