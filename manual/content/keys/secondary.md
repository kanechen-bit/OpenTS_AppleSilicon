Weapon choice scores both slots against each target and takes the higher, so the second slot is used only where it beats the first. Each slot scores as its warhead's [`Verses`](/keys/verses/) percentage against the target's armor multiplied by `1000`, doubled while the target is inside that slot's range and zeroed while the slot cannot fire; a tie goes to [`Primary`](/keys/primary/). The elite substitution never touches this slot.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MYTANK] ; example UnitType
Primary=MyCannon      ; each names its own weapon section
Secondary=MyMachineGun
```

Writing `none` or `<none>` empties the slot, and an ID with no section of its own registers a WeaponType carrying only its defaults.

:::danger[An empty second slot can still be chosen]
When the first slot's warhead is [`Webby=yes`](/keys/webby/), weapon choice answers with the second slot for every target the web weapon could otherwise fire at but cannot web — every vehicle and building, a landed aircraft, and every immobilized or [`IsWebImmune=yes`](/keys/iswebimmune/) infantry. Scoring tolerates an empty slot, but the retaliation test reads the warhead out of it without checking that it is filled, so an object with a web weapon and no second weapon fails as soon as such a target damages it. Always give a web weapon a companion in this slot.
