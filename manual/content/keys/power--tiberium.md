The value is the damage this Tiberium carries, and all three paths that spend it apply their result through [`C4Warhead`](/keys/c4warhead/):

- An infantry object without [`TiberiumProof=yes`](/keys/tiberiumproof/) and without the Tiberium-proof veteran ability takes `Power / 10`, rounded down and never below 1, on every cell of this Tiberium it steps into. That damage is forced, so armor class and [`Immune=yes`](/keys/immune/) do not soften it.
- A chain reaction consumes half the growth stacked in the cell and deals that many stages multiplied by this value at the cell. A result of zero creates no explosion animation and deals no damage; the consumed growth and neighboring reaction checks still proceed.
- With [`TiberiumExplosive=yes`](/keys/tiberiumexplosive/) in `[CombatDamage]`, a harvester destroyed while carrying Tiberium explodes over one and a half cells for the sum, across every Tiberium type in its hold, of the amount carried multiplied by that type's value — unless the scenario grants harvesters immunity.
