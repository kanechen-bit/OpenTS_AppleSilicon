The name promises the warhead an EM pulse cannon discharge detonates with. [Firing the cannon](/systems/emp-pulse/#em-pulse-cannon-superweapon) instead fires the building's own primary weapon, so the pulse comes from that weapon's warhead. Nothing beyond the save file and the cleanup that clears the pointer when a warhead is deleted touches the value stored here.
