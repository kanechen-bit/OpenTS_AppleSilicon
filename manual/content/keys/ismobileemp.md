The flag is what allows the deploy order at all for a vehicle with no [`DeploysInto`](/keys/deploysinto/) type and no passenger capacity, and the deploy cursor is refused while the charge is short of [`MaxCharge`](/keys/maxcharge/). Deploying [fires the hard-coded pulse weapon](/systems/emp-pulse/#mobile-emp-vehicle) at the vehicle's own position and returns it to guard.
