Nothing scatters a homing projectile. A projectile steered by the homing flight model — one whose [`ROT`](/keys/rot/#scope-bullettype) is above zero — flies at the aim point it was given, and an [`Inaccurate=yes`](/keys/inaccurate/) setting on its type does not displace that point.

The one scatter a shot does receive belongs to an arcing projectile and is measured with [`BallisticScatter`](/keys/ballisticscatter/).
