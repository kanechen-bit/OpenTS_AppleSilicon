With the switch off neither the [growth pass nor the spread pass](/systems/tiberium/#growth) runs for any type, and the per-cell growth test fails as well, so no queued cell ripens or seeds — though blossom trees, crates, meteors and scattered loads still place Tiberium. The [Tiberium growth](/mapping/actions/taction-tib-growth/) trigger action writes the same switch while the scenario is running.
