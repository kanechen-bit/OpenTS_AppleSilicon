The three numbers are separated by commas; a value that is not three numbers keeps the default, a dark red. The squares on the line's ends take the same colour. The sighting laser is the line a firing vehicle with [`TargetLaser=yes`](/keys/targetlaser/) draws to where its shot is aimed; [Action lines](/systems/action-lines/) covers when it is drawn.
