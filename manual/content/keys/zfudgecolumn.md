The figure is multiplied by a strength the engine works out from the bridge tiles around the object, and the product is offered as the object's depth bias. The strength is counted only while the object is under a bridge now, or standing where a destroyed bridge span used to pass: a support tile to the south or east contributes 1, and one to the south-east adds another whether or not either of those matched, so the multiplier runs from 0 to 2. Only a road bridge is counted, never a railway one.

Only the largest of the four fudges applies at any moment, so this one has an effect only while it beats whatever [`ZFudgeBridge`](/keys/zfudgebridge/), [`ZFudgeCliff`](/keys/zfudgecliff/) and [`ZFudgeTunnel`](/keys/zfudgetunnel/) are contributing. The winner is added to the bias the object's locomotor asks for and to a second bias the object works out for itself. The stock rules set it on 23 vehicles, between 7 and 18.
