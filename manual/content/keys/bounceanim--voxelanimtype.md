An animation of the named type is created at the debris' position on every frame the bounce physics report a strike — against the ground, against a bridge deck, or against a building or wall standing in the way. A strike inside a water cell is not one of them: the piece there has its lifetime cleared instead and plays nothing.

The landing that ends the flight does not count either. A contact that leaves the piece with too little motion to keep tracking is reported as settling rather than as a strike, so it takes the expiry path directly. A piece carrying [`Elasticity=0`](/keys/elasticity/#scope-voxelanimtype) keeps no speed across a contact, so its arrival on the ground settles it and this animation goes unplayed.
