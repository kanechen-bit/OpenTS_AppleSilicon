Each webbed soldier draws a whole number between minus and plus this figure, inclusive, and that shift is added to [`WebDuration`](/keys/webduration/). The built-in `25` therefore spreads a web across a range of just over three seconds, which is what keeps a group of soldiers caught by one shot from breaking loose together. A figure of `0` gives every soldier the same wait.

```ini title="rules.ini"
[MyWebWH] ; example WarheadType
Webby=yes
Particle=MyWebSys ; example ParticleSystemType
WebDuration=600
WebDurationVariation=90 ; each soldier waits 34 to 46 seconds
```

The sign makes no difference: the two ends of the range are put in order before the draw, so a negative figure behaves exactly as its positive counterpart.

The setting is read only while [`Webby=yes`](/keys/webby/) stands in the same section.

:::caution[A variation larger than the duration can pin nothing]
The shift is applied without a floor. A draw that takes the total to zero or below leaves the soldier's remaining wait untouched, so it plays one struggle and stands straight back up — still having taken no damage from the hit.
