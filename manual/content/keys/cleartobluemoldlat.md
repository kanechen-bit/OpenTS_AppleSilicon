Blue mold blends by the rule [`ClearToRoughLat`](/keys/cleartoroughlat/) describes, against the single plain [`BlueMoldTile`](/keys/bluemoldtile/) ground tile. It is the last family evaluated in the pass, so it sees whatever tile the six before it settled on — and it is one of the four that keep blending even when their set is unresolved.
