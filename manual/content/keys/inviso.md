The projectile is placed at its target coordinate as it is launched, with its speed set to zero, so it covers the distance in no time at all and detonates there. Nothing is drawn on the way, and the drawing routine returns before it reads a frame.

An active firestorm wall standing on the line between firer and target is the one thing that stops it. The projectile is placed at the wall, consumed by it and removed. Walls belonging to the firer's own house let it through; [`IgnoresFirestorm=yes`](/keys/ignoresfirestorm/) does not, because that setting is only consulted by a projectile that is actually in flight.

Because the impact would otherwise land on exactly the same spot every time, the explosion animation is thrown 32 leptons — an eighth of a cell — from the detonation point in a random direction. The damage itself is applied at the detonation point.

An aircraft whose first weapon fires an invisible projectile makes no strafing runs.
