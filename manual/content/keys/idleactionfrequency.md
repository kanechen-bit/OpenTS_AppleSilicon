Every time an infantryman performs an idle action it sets its own next one, drawing a random interval between half the value and twice it, so the figure is the middle of a spread rather than a fixed period. The value is in minutes at fifteen frames a second, which makes the default a wait of between two and a half and ten seconds. One figure covers the whole game, so lowering it makes every infantryman on the map fidget more often rather than picking out a type.

The wait is only checked while the infantryman is standing still with nothing worth shooting at, under a guard, hunt or guard-area mission. The interval is therefore a floor rather than a schedule: one under fire or on the move never reaches the check at all.

When it does fire, one of eleven equally likely outcomes is drawn — an idle animation, an idle animation with a turn and an occasional muttered [`VoiceComment`](/keys/voicecomment/), a turn to a random facing, or nothing. A frightened [`Fraidycat=yes`](/keys/fraidycat/) infantryman under a computer house scatters instead of drawing at all.

Only infantry idle. Vehicles, aircraft and structures have no idle action and never consult the value.
