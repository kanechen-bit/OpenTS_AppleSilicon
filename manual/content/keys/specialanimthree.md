[Building animations](/systems/building-animations/) covers the slot mechanism all three share, and [what starts a special animation](/keys/specialanim/#what-starts-a-special-animation) covers which structures reach a special slot at all. The third slot belongs to a [`UnitRepair=yes`](/keys/unitrepair/) depot alone: it is created as a repair visit ends, and no part of the repair cycle stops it afterward, so an animation that loops here holds the slot until the structure is sold or otherwise taken off the map. Neither the fill indicator of a [`SiloDamage=yes`](/keys/silodamage/) structure nor a [`FirestormWall=yes`](/keys/firestormwall/) section ever reaches it.
