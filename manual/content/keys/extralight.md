The figure is added to the lighting level of the cell the structure stands on, on the scale where 1000 is the unmodified level. `ExtraLight=-100` therefore draws the structure a tenth of full brightness darker than the ground beneath it.

```ini title="art.ini"
[MYICBM] ; example missile launcher, drawn from its own Image ID
ExtraLight=-100
```

It reaches the structure's main shape, its [`BibShape`](/keys/bibshape/) apron and its [`UnderDoorAnim`](/keys/underdooranim/), and the copy of the structure drawn under fog. It does not reach the [`DoorAnim`](/keys/dooranim/) frames, which are drawn at the cell's own level, nor the door frames of a [`Gate=yes`](/keys/gate/) structure, nor any attached animation, which is a separate object with its own lighting.

A [`TerrainPalette=yes`](/keys/terrainpalette/) structure takes its brightness from the cell's tile lighting instead while it is drawn normally, and this figure does not reach it. Its fogged copy is not drawn that way and keeps the figure.
