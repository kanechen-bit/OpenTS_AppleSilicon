The exemption covers two separate points. A member of such a team is skipped when an aimed bolt [builds its candidate list](/systems/ion-storms/#where-it-strikes), unless the member's own type carries [`LightningRod=yes`](/keys/lightningrod/), which puts it back in. Separately, explosion damage passes over a member whenever the detonating warhead is the one [`IonStormWarhead`](/keys/ionstormwarhead/) names, so a random bolt that lands on the team still leaves it untouched.

The immunity belongs to the team, not to the object type: a member that leaves the team loses it, and an object that never joined a team never had it. The storm's other effects are unaffected — an immune team's aircraft still crash and its hover units still lose power.
