Nearly every automatic behavior with an entry in the `[IQ]` section compares that entry against this number, so raising it switches those behaviors on in the order their thresholds fall. Two entries are exceptions: [`SellBack`](/keys/sellback/) compares against the house's tech level instead, and [`ContentScan`](/keys/contentscan/) is compared in a routine nothing calls. [`RepairSell`](/keys/repairsell/) is the threshold that turns on [automatic repair and sell-back](/systems/repair/#when-the-computer-repairs).

Two rules override what a scenario writes here. A value above [`MaxIQLevels`](/keys/maxiqlevels/) is replaced by `1`, not by the maximum, so an over-large number switches nearly everything off rather than on. Outside campaign games every computer house holds the maximum level, which leaves this setting meaningful there only for a house under player control.
