The value is a plain count of cells. Unlike [`GuardRange=`](/keys/guardrange/) and the other distance settings on the same section, or a weapon's [`Range=`](/keys/range/), it is not converted from cells to leptons when it is read, and the code that needs a lepton figure multiplies it itself.

At zero the type reveals nothing. An aircraft type is the exception: `Sight=0` is what sends it down the [`AircraftFogReveal`](/keys/aircraftfogreveal/) path, which lifts fog without touching the shroud.

The stored figure is only the starting point. [Sight range](/systems/map-visibility/#sight-range) covers the height bonus and the veteran multiplier applied over it, and the cap of ten cells that the scan applies to the result.
