[General]
IonLightningDamage=500
```

The figure is spent twice over. It is [applied through `IonStormWarhead`](/systems/ion-storms/#what-a-strike-does) across the standard 1.5-cell explosion radius with no source recorded, so armor, distance, and the warhead's own table decide what each object actually loses and no house is credited with a kill. It also selects the explosion animation for the strike and, when the warhead carries [`Bright=yes`](/keys/bright/), sizes the spotlight flash.

The same value is used by the scripted [Lightning strike at...](/mapping/actions/taction-ion-lightning-strike/) action, which fires the identical routine at a waypoint whether or not a storm is running.
