The flag is one of the eight that make a structure [one of the deployed-vehicle kinds](/keys/deploysinto/). Such a structure is put down on the deploying vehicle's own cell rather than one cell away, returns to that cell when it [undeploys](/keys/undeploysinto/), may be taken back down whether or not the session allows redeploying, and has sparks attached by [an EM pulse](/systems/emp-pulse/#what-a-pulse-reaches) as it is stunned.

Two effects belong to this flag alone, and both are about stowing the gun. Deconstruction is held at its first step until the barrel pitch has come back to [`StartPitch`](/keys/startpitch/) and the body to [`StartFacing`](/keys/startfacing/), so the structure keeps turning and nothing else in the sequence begins until it arrives. The vehicle produced by the undeploy is then created with its barrel already at `StartPitch`.

A computer-owned Juggernaut also packs itself up when it is handed a target beyond the range of a primary weapon that is not anti-aircraft: the target is dropped and the structure is sent straight into deconstruction, unless it is immobilized. [`TickTank=yes`](/keys/ticktank/) and [`Artillary=yes`](/keys/artillary/) structures share that.
