Only one kind of hit reaches this list: the single blow that carries the object from at or above half its maximum strength to below it — and not even that one if it also carries the object into condition red, which is reported instead and says nothing, so the biggest hits are the quietest. That hit then speaks on a 30% roll, so most objects cross the threshold silently, and further damage below the threshold says nothing at all. The transition is measured per hit, so repairing back above half strength arms the response again.

One entry is picked at random and played at the object's center, fading with distance from the visible screen; there is no test of whose house the object belongs to. Names are matched and picked as [`VoiceSelect`](/keys/voiceselect/) describes.
