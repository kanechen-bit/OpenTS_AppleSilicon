Scattering is the short move an object makes to get out of the way of something. Three decisions read this setting, and it is only one of several ways past each of them.

An object that has just been hit and is allowed to answer the attacker scatters under **All of:**

- it has no target of its own;
- it has no destination of its own;
- **Any of:** this is on, or it has earned the scatter ability.

That one applies to every house alike, computer and player.

An object that has just been hit and is not allowed to answer scatters under **All of:**

- it is not tethered;
- it is standing still;
- it has no target of its own;
- it has no destination of its own;
- it is not an aircraft;
- **Any of:** its house is under computer control, this is on, or it has earned the scatter ability.

A cell warned that a threat is coming scatters its occupants under **Any of:**

- an occupant of that cell is elite;
- the warning was raised as overriding;
- this is on;
- the object has earned the scatter ability;
- the object's house's IQ has reached [`[IQ] Scatter`](/keys/scatter/#scope-global-rules).

The first three of those settle the whole cell at once; the last two are read per object, so one occupant can scatter while its neighbor stays put.

Infantry adds a refusal of its own on top. A soldier belonging to a house a person commands turns a scatter down outright unless this is on, the soldier has earned the scatter ability, the move was forced, the warning was overriding, or the soldier belongs to a team. Vehicles carry no such refusal.

The mission an object is on can forbid scattering before any of this is reached; [`Scatter`](/keys/scatter/#scope-mission-behavior) covers that.
