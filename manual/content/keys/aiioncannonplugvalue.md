The rating covers a structure carrying [`IsPlug=yes`](/keys/isplug/), which in the shipped rules is the upgrade host that plugs fit into; a fitted plug is deleted as it is placed and is never itself a target. Like every list in this family it is read at the firing house's own difficulty slot, and must carry one entry each for easy, normal and hard; a missing or short list is read past its end. The rating is consulted only while [the target's strength is at or below `IonCannonDamage`](/systems/superweapons/#the-computers-use) — a structure above that figure keeps the flat structure rating of 3.
