The resolved set reaches exactly one test, which asks whether a cell carries a paved road slope, and nothing calls it. A road climbing a ramp is drawn from these pieces and treated as whatever their artwork reports; the role changes none of that. [`DirtRoadSlopes`](/keys/dirtroadslopes/) is the dirt counterpart, and it is equally inert.
