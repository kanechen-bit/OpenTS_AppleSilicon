The ten tiles are variants of one decoration and are drawn from evenly. They are unrelated to [`RoughTile`](/keys/roughtile/), which is the plain rough *ground* a whole cell is made of; these are placed as pieces over ground that is already there, and a piece is refused unless every cell it covers is clear ground, or a ramp whose type matches the piece's own. Nothing on that path tests whether a cell is occupied, so a unit or a structure standing there does not turn a placement away.

Nothing outside the random map generator reads the role. The generator scatters between 5 and 30 of them across a map — on desert and mutated maps, and on every tundra and taiga map — giving up after twenty times as many attempts as pieces wanted, successes counted among them. Because a random map is stored as a seed and rebuilt by each player at load time, a theater that leaves this role unresolved affects every client that plays such a map, not just the machine that generated it.
