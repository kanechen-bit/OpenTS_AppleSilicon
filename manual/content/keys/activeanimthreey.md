The vertical half of the third slot's offset. It carries the [`ActiveAnimThree`](/keys/activeanimthree/) animation down the screen from the point the structure is drawn at, and a negative figure lifts it above that point instead. The offset pins the animation to a point on the artwork rather than to a cell, so it holds wherever the structure stands.

[Placement and draw order](/systems/building-animations/#placement-and-draw-order) covers how the offset differs from the two draw-order biases, and [Where each setting is read from](/systems/building-animations/#where-each-setting-is-read-from) covers when the two figures are read.
