Seven names are recognized, in any letter case: `MultiMissile`, `EMPulse`, `Firestorm`, `IonCannon`, `HunterSeeker`, `ChemMissile` and `DropPod`. Each selects one of [the effects the engine can deliver](/systems/superweapons/#what-each-behavior-delivers); everything else about the weapon — its delay, its cameo, its cursor, the structure that grants it — comes from the other settings in the section, so several sections may name the same behavior and remain independent weapons.

A name the engine does not recognize is not rejected and does not clear the value: the assignment is skipped and whatever was already in force stands. In a section that has never named a behavior, that leaves the weapon with none, and it charges, shows a cameo and can be fired while delivering nothing.

The value is also what the [firestorm defense](/systems/superweapons/#the-firestorm-defense) needs before raising and lowering the wall does anything, even though the drain state machine that governs it is switched on by [`UseChargeDrain=yes`](/keys/usechargedrain/) instead.
