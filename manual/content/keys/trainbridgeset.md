The set is laid out exactly like the road one and is read through the same ten `Bridge` position keys; [`BridgeSet`](/keys/bridgeset/) covers how a position is turned into a tile.

This set alone decides which kind of span an engineer rebuilds. On arrival at a [`BridgeRepairHut=yes`](/keys/bridgerepairhut/) structure the five-by-five block of cells centered on the soldier is searched, and one tile of this set anywhere inside it selects the rail repair; the road repair runs otherwise. [Repairing a bridge](/systems/capture/#repairing-a-bridge) covers the rest of that arrival.

Combat damage takes the sets in the other order. A struck cell carrying a low bridge overlay is handled as a low bridge and neither set is consulted; otherwise the road set is tested first, and the cell reaches the rail handler only once it has failed both the road middle-piece test and the road deck test that [`BridgeMiddle1`](/keys/bridgemiddle1/) covers.

:::caution[An unresolved set claims the theater's first tiles]
The railway-bridge test carries no guard against a role that no tile set answered. Left unresolved, it accepts every tile index from `0` through `14`, so the first fifteen tiles the theater loads answer as railway bridge pieces wherever it is asked.
