The value is a fraction of a minute, multiplied by 900 frames where it is used, so a docked object gains one point of [`Ammo`](/keys/ammo/) every 45 frames at the default. It is read in one place only: the branch a [`UnitReload=yes`](/keys/unitreload/) building runs. Nothing about weapon reloading between shots, repair timing or aircraft turnaround consults it.
