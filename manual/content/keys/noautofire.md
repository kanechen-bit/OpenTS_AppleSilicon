Every automatic target scan by an object of this type ends immediately, with no target, while the object belongs to a human-controlled house. A computer house never consults the setting, so the same type scans normally in computer hands.

Only the scan is suppressed. A target given by a player order, by a team script or by the retaliation path is unaffected, and the object still fires at whatever it has been handed.
