  note: The difficulty block is re-read from fixed defaults whenever its section is present, so a later file that carries the section without this key restores 1 rather than keeping the earlier value.

`[Easy]`, `[Normal]` and `[Difficult]` each carry their own multiplier, and a house takes the one for the difficulty slot it is assigned. Every object that house produces has its build time multiplied by it, alongside the [country's own multiplier](/keys/buildtime/#scope-housetype) outside campaign games and [`GameSpeedBias`](/keys/gamespeedbias/) everywhere.

In a campaign game a house under the player's control takes the slot for the difficulty selected for the mission and every other house takes the computer slot, so the two sides can be tuned apart.
