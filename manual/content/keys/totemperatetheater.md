The name promises the tile set that takes this one's place when a map is converted to the temperate theater — a conversion only a map editor performs. The value is stored on the first tile of each entry in the set and read back by nothing: no conversion, no draw, and not the multiplayer synchronization checksum, which never visits the isometric tile types.

The lettered alternates of a tile do not receive the value at all, so even the stored copy covers only part of the set.
