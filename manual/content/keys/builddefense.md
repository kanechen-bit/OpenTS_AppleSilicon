A computer house does not pick its defenses from a list. Candidates are gathered at the moment a defense node is filled in, from every type it may own that carries a value above zero in the category [the defense planner](/systems/ai-base-building/#base-defenses) has chosen, and those values are computed from each type's own weapon. Naming a type here neither adds it to that pool nor keeps it out.
