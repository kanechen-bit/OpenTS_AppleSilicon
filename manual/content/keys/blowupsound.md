```

The sound is played from the structure's own position, so it fades with distance from the view, and only on the hit that crosses a threshold: from at or above half the structure's maximum strength, rounded down, to below that, or from above [`ConditionRed`](/keys/conditionred/) of that strength to below it. Continued damage at the same condition is silent, and a hit that crosses both thresholds at once plays the sound once.

Only structures reach it. A vehicle, an infantryman or an aircraft crossing the same thresholds makes no sound of its own.
