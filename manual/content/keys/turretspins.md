Only a vehicle reads the flag. Once per frame its turret facing is snapped forward by 8 of the 256 directions — one thirty-second of a circle — so the turret comes round once every 32 frames, a little over two seconds, at a rate no [`ROT`](/keys/rot/#scope-aircrafttype) can change.

The snap replaces the facing outright rather than setting a direction to turn toward, so an aim given to the turret earlier in the same frame is discarded before it can be acted on: a spinning turret never settles on a target. Nothing draws a turret unless the type also carries [`Turret=yes`](/keys/turret/), so on a type without one the spin is invisible.

No stock type sets the flag.
