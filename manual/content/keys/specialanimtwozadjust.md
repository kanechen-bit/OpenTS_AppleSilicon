The bias that decides whether the second special slot's animation is drawn over the structure or behind it. [Placement and draw order](/systems/building-animations/#placement-and-draw-order) covers which direction each sign moves it and the byte the figure has to fit in, and [`SpecialAnim`](/systems/building-animations/#where-each-setting-is-read-from) covers why it is not written in the same section as the slot's animation names.
