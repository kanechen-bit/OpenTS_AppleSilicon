The value is matched against the [object categories](/reference/enums/object-category/), which accept either the short token or the longer editor description and ignore case. A value matching neither spelling discards the stored category and leaves the type uncategorized.

An InfantryType categorized `Civilian` is left out of the cameo list on the dropship loadout screen a scenario opens when its `[Basic] StartingDropships` is above zero — and only on the fallback list that screen builds when the scenario declares no [`AllowableUnits`](/keys/allowableunits/) of its own.

Nothing else consults the category.
