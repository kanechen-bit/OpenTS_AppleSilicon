Infantry types replace [`RepairStep`](/keys/repairstep/) with this figure wherever a step is applied to them, which in practice means [a hospital visit](/systems/repair/#hospitals-and-armories) and standing on Tiberium with [`TiberiumHeal=yes`](/keys/tiberiumheal/#scope-aircrafttype). Both sites raise anything below `1` to `1`, so a value of `0` still heals a point at a time.

Infantry also replace the credit price of a step with zero, so this is the whole of what a hospital charges and gives.
