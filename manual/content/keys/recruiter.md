Without it a team considers only objects carrying its own [group](/systems/ai-team-production/#recruitment), unless that group is `-2`, which matches everything; a team on any other group that no object shares recruits nobody. Setting it widens the scan to every object of the right kind. The 50-cell distance penalty a candidate outside the group is ranked with still applies, so a candidate that does match the group is preferred while one stands within that margin.
