Pavement blends by the rule [`ClearToRoughLat`](/keys/cleartoroughlat/) describes, and its neighbor test is the widest of the families. Besides the plain [`PaveTile`](/keys/pavetile/) tile and these sixteen, a neighbor also counts as pavement when it is one of the fourteen [`MiscPaveTile`](/keys/miscpavetile/) pieces, one of the fourteen [`Medians`](/keys/medians/) pieces, or one of the first eight paved road tiles. Laying a road or a median strip through a paved square therefore does not cut a blended edge into it.

When the set is unresolved the whole pavement family is skipped and pavement keeps its square edges.
