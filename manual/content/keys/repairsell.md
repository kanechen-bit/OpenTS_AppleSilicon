The house's [`IQ`](/keys/iq/) is compared against this figure before anything else in [the computer's repair decision](/systems/repair/#when-the-computer-repairs), and it gates the sell-back branch on the same test. Computer houses outside campaign games hold the maximum intelligence level, so the gate is open for them whenever this is at or below [`MaxIQLevels`](/keys/maxiqlevels/); in a campaign the mission's own house entries decide it.

A house under player control skips the captured-or-flagged test that limits which buildings a computer repairs, so raising the player house's `IQ` to this level in a map hands the player automatic, unprompted repair of every damaged building it owns — money and the one-start-per-pass throttle still apply.
