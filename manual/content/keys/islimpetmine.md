The flag is one of the eight that make a structure [one of the deployed-vehicle kinds](/keys/deploysinto/): put down on the deploying vehicle's own cell rather than one cell away, returned to that cell when it undeploys, and taken back down whether or not the session allows redeploying.

Four further effects follow from it.

- A vehicle is never blocked by one. The mine is skipped by the test a vehicle runs before entering a cell, the same way an [`InvisibleInGame=yes`](/keys/invisibleingame/) structure is, so traffic drives straight over it.
- A selected limpet mine offers no attack cursor over anything, so a player cannot force fire it — the same suppression an [`EMPulseCannon=yes`](/keys/empulsecannon/) structure gets, withholding the cursor over an object and over a bare cell alike. That is the suppression an [`EMPulseCannon=yes`](/keys/empulsecannon/) structure also gets, and it withholds the cursor over an object and over a bare cell alike.
- [An EM pulse destroys it outright](/systems/emp-pulse/#what-a-pulse-reaches) with the firing house credited, where every other structure in the blast is only powered off and stunned.
- The [Deploy Object](/commands/deployobject/) command accepts it. Every other structure fails that command's readiness test unless it carries [`Passengers=`](/keys/passengers/) of its own; this flag and [`IsMobileWar=yes`](/keys/ismobilewar/) clear it outright.
