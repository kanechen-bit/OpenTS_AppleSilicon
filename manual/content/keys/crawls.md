The flag decides one thing: how fast a soldier of the type moves while it is prone. Set, prone movement is the type's speed less a third of it. Clear, prone movement is the type's speed plus half of it, so a soldier that ducks rather than crawls covers ground faster lying down than it does upright.

It does not choose an animation. A prone soldier that moves is put into the `Crawl` run of its [`Sequence`](/keys/sequence/) section at either setting; the flag only sets the pace.
