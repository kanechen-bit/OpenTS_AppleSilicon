As a reinforcement group builds its members from the TaskForce, each one whose type sets [`Storage`](/keys/storage/) above zero is created with that many units already in its hold, all of them the first Tiberium type in the rules. A member with no storage is unaffected.

```ini title="ai.ini or map file"
[MyHarvesterDelivery] ; example TeamType
Name=Loaded harvesters
TaskForce=MyHarvesterForce ; defined under [TaskForces]
Script=MyHarvesterScript   ; defined under [ScriptTypes]
Full=yes
```

The value is read at the moment a member is created, alongside [`VeteranLevel`](/keys/veteranlevel/), so it reaches only the paths that build a group from the TaskForce. A team that fills its roster by recruiting objects the house already owns never consults it, and nothing tops a member up again after it has spent the load.
