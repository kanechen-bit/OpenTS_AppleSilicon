This is the mood a levitating unit is in whenever it has a target, whether or not it also has a destination — the target is tested first and settles which figure applies. Once a thrust has ended and the unit is coasting, it brakes as soon as its speed has fallen *below* this figure, or as soon as the target is inside [`ProximityDistance`](/keys/proximitydistance/). Braking runs at [`IntentionalDeacceleration`](/keys/intentionaldeacceleration/) until the unit is stopped, and it then thrusts at the target again.

Like [`MaxVelocityWhenFollowing`](/keys/maxvelocitywhenfollowing/), the figure ends a coast rather than capping a speed. At the stock pair — `6.5` here against `5` there — the shorter coast is what makes a levitating unit close on something it means to attack faster than it travels anywhere else. `MaxVelocityWhenFollowing` covers why raising either figure without limit stops paying and eventually costs ground.

:::caution[A figure of zero strands the unit]
The test is a strict comparison against the speed carried, so at `0` the coast never ends on its own. Drag brings the unit to a standstill and it stays there, neither braking nor thrusting again, until its target happens to fall inside `ProximityDistance` or the target is lost.
