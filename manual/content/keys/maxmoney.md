The figure is spent entirely on the setup screens — skirmish, network and online all build their credits slider from `2500` to this value. Nothing during a match compares a house's balance against it, so it neither caps what a house may accumulate nor limits what [`Money`](/keys/money/) can seed; it limits only what a player can choose.

The lower end is fixed in the engine and this setting cannot move it, so raising the starting money floor is not possible from the rules.
