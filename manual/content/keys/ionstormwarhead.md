```ini title="rules.ini"
[General]
IonStormWarhead=MyStormWH ; a WarheadType registered in [Warheads]
```

The warhead's [`Verses`](/keys/verses/) table, its [`Bright`](/keys/bright/) flag, and its animation lists shape [what a bolt does](/systems/ion-storms/#what-a-strike-does) to the objects around the strike point.

:::caution[This assignment also decides who is immune]
Explosion damage skips a team member whose TeamType is [`IonImmune=yes`](/keys/ionimmune/) when the detonating warhead is the one named here — matched as the same warhead, not by name. Giving an ordinary weapon that warhead makes the weapon skip those objects too, and pointing this key at a different warhead moves the exemption with it.
