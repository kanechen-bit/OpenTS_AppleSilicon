A [`UseChargeDrain=yes`](/keys/usechargedrain/) weapon spends its charge while its effect is running, and this figure converts between the two. Firing a fully charged weapon puts a drain of [`RechargeTime`](/keys/rechargetime/) multiplied by this value on the clock; firing it again divides whatever drain is left by the same value and turns it back into charge, so switching the effect off part-way returns the matching share of the charge. The same product is what the cameo clock is drawn against while the effect runs.

Below 1 the effect is shorter than the charge that bought it — the shipped rules set `.333`, which spends the whole three-minute firestorm charge on one minute of wall — and above 1 it runs longer than the charge took to build. One figure in `[General]` covers every charge-draining weapon; [the firestorm generator's charge](/systems/laser-fences/#charge-and-drain) sets out both formulas as the wall uses them.
