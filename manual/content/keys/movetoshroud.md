An order onto a shrouded cell is refused outright at `no`. At `yes` it is accepted, but only while the cell also lies inside the playable area, and every order but a patrol waypoint is reduced to a plain move — an attack click onto shrouded ground sends the object there rather than making it fire.

The same refusal covers an order onto a shrouded object, and that second test runs only in a campaign.

An aircraft section therefore has to state `MoveToShroud=yes` outright to accept such an order at all.
