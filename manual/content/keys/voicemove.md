This list covers every player-issued order that is not an attack — moving, guarding, harvesting, entering a transport, deploying — because the acknowledgement is chosen on a single test for the attack mission and everything else falls here. [`VoiceAttack`](/keys/voiceattack/) is the other side of that test.

One entry is picked at random and played at full volume, without distance fading. Ordering a group produces one response, not one per object: the first object to act speaks and the rest of that order is silenced. Names are matched and picked as [`VoiceSelect`](/keys/voiceselect/) describes.
