summary: Overlay that no other overlay may replace once it is on a cell.

The flag is consulted on the overlay already standing in a cell, not on the one arriving. An overlay being laid down asks whether the cell is empty of overlay or holds one that does not carry this flag; if the answer is no, the placement is refused and the cell keeps what it had. Everything else about the arriving overlay still happens — the object is discarded either way, and a [`CellAnim`](/keys/cellanim/) is created whether or not the cell accepted the overlay.

:::caution[The name reads backward]
Setting the flag does not let a type override others. It protects a type from being overridden, so the overlays it shuts out are the ones written afterward.
:::

The protection lasts only for the placements that happen during play. While the scenario is being set up the test is skipped entirely, so the overlays a map declares are laid down in the order the map gives them and a protected overlay can be replaced by a later one.
