Only the set's first tile is used, as the unbroken green ground that [`ClearToGreenLat`](/keys/cleartogreenlat/) blends against and the tile a green cell reverts to when it is surrounded by green.

The random map generator paints it in patches on temperate and mutated maps — the desert weight is zero — and tests its chance first, before rough and sand, so a cell that draws green never gets the chance to become either of those. Tundra and taiga maps never place it.
