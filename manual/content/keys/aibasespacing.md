Every building that is not a vehicle reserves its footprint grown by this many cells on each side as ground occupied by its owner, and the computer's [placement search](/systems/ai-base-building/#choosing-a-spot) grows a candidate footprint by the same margin before testing it. The reservation is kept for every house, but each house's search consults its own reservations only.

The margin constrains the first placement attempt only; the second attempt drops it and places against the bare footprint.
