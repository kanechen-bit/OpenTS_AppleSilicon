key: FirestormAirAnim
summary: The animation a raised firestorm wall creates when what it catches is more than 100 leptons above the ground.

It is created at the victim's own position rather than the wall's, centered and drawn in front of it, and it runs its animation type's own [`LoopCount`](/keys/loopcount/), which is a single repetition unless the type sets one. The height test is the only thing that chooses between this animation and [`FirestormGroundAnim`](/keys/firestormgroundanim/); the flags, depth adjustment and loop count are identical. Both are created by every path that catches something — the sweep of a section's own cell, a flying object or jumpjet crossing it, and a projectile [consumed by the wall](/systems/laser-fences/#projectiles) — including the projectile path, which produces the animation without applying any damage.

:::danger[An unset value faults the moment the animation is due]
The animation is built from this setting without checking that it resolved to anything. With no value set the pointer is empty, and the first time a raised section catches something above that height, the engine builds an animation from it and reads through that empty pointer straight away.
