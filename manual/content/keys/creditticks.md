summary: The two sounds the credit readout plays as it counts, the first while it rises and the second while it falls.

  note: The list stays empty and both positions are still indexed whenever the readout moves, dereferencing a pointer that was never given storage.

The readout never jumps to the house's money; it walks toward it a step at a time and plays one of these sounds at half volume on every step, so a single transaction is heard as a run of ticks rather than one. [The credit readout](/systems/sidebar/#the-credit-readout) covers how far each step moves and how often one is taken.

:::danger[An empty list crashes the readout]
Only the first two positions are consulted, and they are read without a length check. A list of one entry is indexed past its end, and an empty list holds no storage at all, so the read dereferences a null pointer the first time the player's money changes. Omitting the key leaves exactly that empty list, so every rules tree needs two entries here — this is one of the few settings with no safe absent state.
