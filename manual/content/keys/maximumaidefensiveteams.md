Entries run hardest game setting first, and a computer house indexes them with its own difficulty slot, which is the inverse of the setting the player chose. The test is strict — the house must hold more defensive teams than the entry — and it is reached only while the house is [under `TotalAITeamCap`, or holds fewer defensive teams than half its team count rounded down](/systems/ai-team-production/#the-team-budget). Exceeding the entry suppresses defensive triggers for that one pass; it never deletes a team.
