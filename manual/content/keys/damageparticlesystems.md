The list is one pool that the engine splits by each entry's [`BehavesLike`](/keys/behaveslike/). Only two of those behaviors are ever drawn from it, and an entry with any other behavior is never used.

**Sparks** are the `Spark` entries. A damaged object checks for them on every one of its own passes, while its health ratio is below [`ConditionYellow`](/keys/conditionyellow/) and it is not more than ten leptons underground. If it has no spark system running, one entry is picked from the spark entries at random and attached to the object at its center plus [`DamageSmokeOffset`](/keys/damagesmokeoffset/), on a roll of [`ConditionRedSparkingProbability`](/keys/conditionredsparkingprobability/) once the ratio is below [`ConditionRed`](/keys/conditionred/) and [`ConditionYellowSparkingProbability`](/keys/conditionyellowsparkingprobability/) until then. Sparks are switched off for every InfantryType except a [`Cyborg=yes`](/keys/cyborg/) one, and switched on for everything else; there is no key for it.

**Smoke** are the `Smoke` entries, and they are attached on a damaging hit rather than on a pass. The hit must be the one that carries the object below half strength or below `ConditionRed`, the health ratio must be at or below `ConditionYellow` with no smoke already running, and the object must not be more than ten leptons underground. One smoke entry is picked at random and attached at the object's position plus `DamageSmokeOffset`. Repairing back above `ConditionYellow`, or sinking further than ten leptons underground, removes it again.

An object may run one spark system and one smoke system at a time, so a longer list widens the choice rather than the count.
