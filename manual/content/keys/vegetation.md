summary: How thickly a generated map is planted with green ground and trees, as a figure from 0 to 100.

  note: The read passes the current setting through, and the generator's settings outlive one map, so an omitted assignment keeps whatever the last map built in this session left behind.

Each cell is given a chance of each kind of ground cover before any of it is planted, and the figure scales those chances as a percentage. It reaches the green ground and the woods only: the rough ground and the sand are given fixed chances per biome and are laid down at the same rate whatever the figure says. [Map seed files](/formats/map-seed/) covers the section it is written in.

```ini title="map seed file"
[RandomMap]
Biome=2
Vegetation=70
```

The chances are small even at the full figure, and differ per biome: a temperate or mutated cell then has one chance in fifty of green ground and about one in three hundred of a wood, while a desert cell has no chance of green ground at all and is given sand instead. A cell on a shoreline is treated far more generously — its green and wood chances are the scaled figures multiplied by ten, which is what puts the trees along the water.

At `0` no green ground and no woods are seeded anywhere, and the map is left with only its rough patches, its sand and whatever the settlement and tiberium passes add.
