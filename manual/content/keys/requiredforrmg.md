Tile artwork is trimmed after the map has been read: the loader counts how many cells use each tile type and throws away the image of every type the count leaves at zero, so only the part of a theater a scenario actually needs stays resident. On a generated map that count is misleading, because the generator goes on placing tiles after the trim. A set carrying this flag is exempt from the trim on a generated map, and its artwork is loaded instead of discarded.

```ini title="TEMPERAT.INI"
[TileSet0042]        ; example set the generator lays down as it works
SetName=Shore pieces
FileName=SHORE
TilesInSet=12
RequiredForRMG=yes
```

The exemption applies only on a generated map. On an ordinary scenario the trim runs as though the flag were not there, and a set nothing uses loses its artwork whatever it says. Reaching a draw reloads it, so the flag governs when the read happens rather than whether the artwork can be had at all.
