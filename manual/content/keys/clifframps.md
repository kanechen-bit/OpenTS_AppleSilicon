  note: The role stays unresolved, because no tile set number can match it, and the generator's cliff test then treats the theater's first nineteen tiles as cliff ramps.

The twenty pieces from this role count as cliff, which is the whole of what the setting does: the cliff test that random map generation runs treats a tile in this range exactly as it treats one from [`CliffSet`](/keys/cliffset/), so the generator neither counts a cliff ramp as ground when it decides which cells to raise nor lays a shore piece over one. Cliff ramps are rock face, not the walkable ramps of [`RampBase`](/keys/rampbase/). [Theater control files](/formats/theater-control/) explains how a `[General]` role is resolved to a live tile index.

Whether a cliff ramp can be crossed is settled by the land type its artwork carries, not by this setting, so leaving the role unresolved changes generation alone.
