The value is a filename without its extension, and only a non-empty value is taken. The named `<value>.SHP` is loaded with the rules, and refetched on the same occasions and with the same theater rewrite [`DoorAnim`](/keys/dooranim/) describes.

While the structure is unloading, this file is drawn in place of the structure's main shape, and the type's [`NormalZAdjust`](/keys/normalzadjust/) is dropped to zero for that draw. The frame is still the structure's own current frame number, held so that the highest it can reach is the frame at half the count of whichever file is in use — one past the last of the healthy frames — so a deploying shape has to follow the same healthy-then-damaged layout as the main artwork. That limit sits on the main draw itself and applies whether or not a deploying shape is in use.
