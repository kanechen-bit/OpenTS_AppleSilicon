An instance is created with a full pool. A count of exactly zero is what refuses a shot, and a negative pool only ever moves further from that zero, so the default of `-1` is an unlimited supply rather than an empty one.

A building refills its pool the instant it empties — except for a [`Hospital=yes`](/keys/hospital/) or [`Armory=yes`](/keys/armory/) building, where the pool is spent one point per visitor admitted and is never restocked. On those two types the value is the number of visits the building will ever serve, and leaving it unset gives exactly one; [Hospitals and armories](/systems/repair/#hospitals-and-armories) traces the admission.

A vehicle or aircraft that has run its pool down is refilled at a [`UnitReload=yes`](/keys/unitreload/) building one point at a time, or in one free step at a service depot if it is [`ManualReload=yes`](/keys/manualreload/).
