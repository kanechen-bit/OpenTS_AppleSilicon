Once the shape steps past [`AnimHigh`](/keys/animhigh/) it starts again here rather than at the beginning of the artwork, which is how a projectile holds a few leading frames outside the loop.

The animation runs at all only while one of the two frame numbers is other than `0`. With both left at `0` the shape is picked from the projectile's heading instead, which is what [`Rotates`](/keys/rotates/) controls; with either set, the animation frame is drawn and the heading is never consulted.

A new projectile always starts on frame `0`, so a value above zero is passed over on the first run through and only takes effect from the second. Setting it higher than `AnimHigh` leaves the shape standing still on this frame, because the very next step is already past the last frame of the loop.

The figure is stored in a single byte, so `256` stores as zero and anything above `255` wraps around.

The setting is read from the art section named by the projectile's [`Image`](/keys/image/). That assignment is required. Without it the lookup runs against an empty section name, so nothing here is read — not even from an art section named after the projectile, which is where its [`Voxel`](/keys/voxel/) setting is still found.
