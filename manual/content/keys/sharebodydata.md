The model comes from the object type named by [`ShareSource`](/keys/sharesource/) rather than from a `.VXL` file of the animation's own. This flag claims the source's body model — the one the source's own instances are drawn from.

The three sharing flags are tested in a fixed order and the first one set decides the part: body, then turret, then barrel. Setting more than one is therefore not additive, and a type carrying both this flag and [`ShareTurretData=yes`](/keys/shareturretdata/) takes the body.

:::danger[Dropping the flag in a later file frees the lender's model]
A later rules or map file that declares the same section again without repeating this flag turns the borrowing off, and the section is read as owning its model: the borrowed one is released and a fresh one loaded in its place. The lending object type is then drawn out of freed memory, and its motion data is released a second time when the game shuts down, corrupting the heap. [`ShareSource`](/keys/sharesource/) covers the borrowing in full.
