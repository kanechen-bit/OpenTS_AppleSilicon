Only the set's first tile is used, as the unbroken mold that [`ClearToBlueMoldLat`](/keys/cleartobluemoldlat/) blends against and the tile a mold cell reverts to when mold surrounds it.

Blue mold is a mutated-biome feature of the random map generator, which maps to the temperate theater. A cell is molded when all four of its orthogonal neighbors are clear or already molded — its own tile is never examined, so mold can overwrite whatever was there. The generator then makes up to four random draws among the molded cells, dressing each drawn cell with a mutated terrain object or a patch of large Tiberium.
