A house selling its base back to afford a harvester now counts every `BuildWeapons` entry as a war factory. It asked only the first two, and asked for the second without checking that the list had one, so a one-entry list was read past its end.

AlexB is credited for the ts-patches bundle that first read these lists whole.
