The sweep that reveals a new ally's objects and the one that reveals a spied house's
objects now have each object take an ordinary look instead of revealing its bare `Sight=`.
The height bonus and veteran sight count, an object never locked to the playable area
stays dark, a landed aircraft shows one cell, and a structure reveals from the cell it
stands on rather than from its centre.
