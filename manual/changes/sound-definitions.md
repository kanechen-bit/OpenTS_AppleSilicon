title: Define sounds with the Yuri's Revenge SOUND.INI keys
category: feature
release: 0.2.0
breaking: true
migration:
- A `Volume=` above 1 is now a percentage, so a value that used to boost a sound beyond its sample now quietens it. Remove such values or write `Volume=100`.

A sound section may now list several samples, loop them with attack and decay samples and random or ordered bodies, delay between cycles, shift pitch and volume at random, limit how many copies play at once, and set how far from the view it is heard. `[Defaults]` supplies the values a section omits and `[General] Channels=` sets how many sound effects play at once. The shipped files read unchanged, and sections written for Yuri's Revenge read with their named priorities and percent volumes.

CCHyper is credited for the Vinifera additions to the grammar this follows: `SEQUENTIAL`, `QUEUE`, `SHROUDED` and `UNSHROUDED`.
