In-game chat now has a line to the team and, for an observer, a line to the other observers,
beside the lines to everyone and to one player it always had. Backspace starts a team line and
Enter a line to everyone unless the keyboard file gives those keys or commands to something
else. A line is delivered and shown only where its kind allows: a team line reaches the houses
the sender is allied with, an observers line the other observers, and a line from outside the
match is dropped, so the `-MESSAGES` switch that let such lines through is gone.

dkeeton is credited for the ts-patches team and observer chat this follows, and CCHyper for
the Vinifera routing and echo.
