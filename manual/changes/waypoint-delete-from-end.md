Delete Waypoint with no waypoint picked up now removes the last waypoint of the selected path, so pressing it repeatedly takes the path apart from the end; before, it did nothing unless a waypoint was held. A path's loop now survives a deletion: the waypoint it returns to keeps its place when an earlier one is removed, and the loop moves on to the next waypoint when the return waypoint itself is removed, where before either removal opened the loop.

dkeeton is credited for the ts-patches change the first part follows.
