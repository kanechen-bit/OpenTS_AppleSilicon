The veterancy filter narrows a mixed selection to its highest rank and, pressed again, moves on
to the next rank of the selection it started from; the health filter does the same with the
red, yellow and green condition bands, starting from the most damaged units. The add-lower forms
grow a filtered selection back by one tier instead of replacing it. Select One Less drops the
most recently selected unit. All five arrive unbound, and neither filter acts while a structure
is being placed.

hacklex is credited for the Vinifera filters this follows and dkeeton for the ts-patches
command that removes one unit.
