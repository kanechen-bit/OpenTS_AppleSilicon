A house's random starting vehicles and infantry are now put down between three and
thirty-two cells from its start position, leaving the cells around the base unit clear, and
they stay where they are put. They were put down from one cell out, and a human player's were
then each ordered a cell further away, so a match opened with the units still shuffling around
the construction vehicle. The base unit is placed as before, on the start position or the
nearest cell that takes it.

The same random seed places every house differently from earlier builds, so a seeded launch
no longer reproduces an earlier build's opening layout.

CCHyper is credited for the Vinifera implementation this one follows.
