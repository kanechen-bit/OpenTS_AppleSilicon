A skirmish or multiplayer map may now write `Allies=` in `[Spawn1]` through `[Spawn8]`, naming
spawn houses or countries, and the house starting at that position begins the match allied to
them, one way, in addition to whatever the launch file arranged. Only a campaign read the key
before. A section for a position nobody holds is ignored.
