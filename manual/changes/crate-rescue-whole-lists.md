A unit crate now judges its free harvester on every `BuildRefinery` and `HarvesterUnit` entry and hands out the first harvester the collector's country may own, where it compared entry 0 of each alone. The random vehicle draw that follows now stops when no UnitType qualifies; a rules set where nothing is both `CrateGoodie=yes` and ownable by the collector hung the game on the spot.

AlexB is credited for the ts-patches bundle that first read these lists whole.
