Two commands save and load a campaign or skirmish game without the options menu. Quick Save
writes `QUICKSAVE.SAV` in a campaign and `QUICKSAVE_SKIRMISH.SAV` in a skirmish, behind the
saving box a menu save shows, and reports the result in the message list; Quick Load restores
the file for the kind of game being played, or says there is none. Both arrive unbound, and
neither acts in a game against other machines, while input is locked, or once the game is
being won or lost.
