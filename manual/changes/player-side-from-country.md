A mission's art, interface and voices now follow the side of the country `Player=` names, and a lobby game's follow the side of the country the player chose. The choice was a text comparison against `GDI`: anything else, a third country included, was presented as Nod, and a third side could be reached only by naming it in `SpeechSide=`, and only for voices. A side without archives of its own is presented with the first side's instead of abandoning the load. A saved game now records the player's country and its side in place of a flag.
