Four commands queue another of the last item of their kind that finished for the player: a
structure, an infantry unit, a vehicle or an aircraft. The item must still be offered on the
sidebar. A structure is refused while one is under construction or waits to be placed; the other
kinds queue behind whatever the factory is doing, as a click on the cameo would. All four arrive
unbound and take whatever key the keyboard options assign.

CCHyper is credited for the Vinifera commands this follows and dkeeton for the ts-patches
building hotkey.
