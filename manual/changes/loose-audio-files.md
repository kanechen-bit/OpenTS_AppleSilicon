A sound effect's sample is now looked up through the file layer when it first plays, so a loose file in the game directory and a member of any mounted archive both play, and a loose file replaces an archived one. Before, a sample had to be in an archive cached at startup. `.WAV`, `.OGG`, `.FLAC` and `.MP3` samples are accepted alongside `.AUD`.

CCHyper is credited for the Vinifera sound loading this follows, which accepts the same formats from loose files.
