Starting the game with `-SPAWN` now plays the match `SPAWN.INI` describes: a skirmish, a
campaign mission, a game against other machines through a CnCNet tunnel or straight between
them, or any of those resumed from a saved game. The startup movies and the menu are
skipped, and the game exits when the match ends.

A client-launched game against other machines can now be saved from its options dialog.

The people credited here wrote the earlier spawners this one follows.
