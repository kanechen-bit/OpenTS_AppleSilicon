`[General] MultiMCV=yes` lets a construction yard produce for every country in a structure's `Owner` list rather than only for the country it was built by, in the sidebar and in the factory search alike. The key, its default of `no` and its meaning are Vinifera's, so a rules set written for it carries over.
