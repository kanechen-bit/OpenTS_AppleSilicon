A save carries the scenario file it was played from when the deployment's `OPENTS.INI` sets
`CarryScenarioFile=yes`, and a restart or the replay after a loss then reads the mission
from that copy rather than from disk. That lets a mission resumed through the CnCNet client
be restarted: the client replaces `spawnmap.ini` with a stub on resume, and the restart read
the stub and crashed. The key is off by default, since a large map adds half again to a save.
