A skirmish or multiplayer map that sets `[Basic] UseMPAIBaseNodes=yes` hands each house the
base node list written in the section of the start position it holds, `[Spawn1]` through
`[Spawn8]`, and a computer house then follows that plan as a campaign house does: its nodes
go where they are written, no power plant is inserted ahead of them, it does not sell its base
to raise money, and it rebuilds a lost defense in place. Maps without the key play as before.

Rampastring and CCHyper are credited for the Vinifera implementation this one follows.
