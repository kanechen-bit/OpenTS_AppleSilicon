A scenario can carry a `[Tutorial]` section of its own, replacing a line `TUTORIAL.INI` supplies or
adding one for as long as that mission is played, so mission text no longer has to go into the one
file every player shares. Those lines travel with the mission's saved game, since a load never
re-reads the map. A line is no longer cut at 299 characters, and a key that is not a whole number is
skipped and logged rather than read as line 0.
